“The profession of attorneys requires strong moral strength, as you put yourselves in accused person’s shoes and try to prove to the society and the state that justification might exist in every fault.
You defend exactly what I am responsible to defend according to the Constitution – human rights. It is the right of every individual to have unbiased court system.
You have endured many hardships. We have heard about the attorneys who were often brutally treated by the system and also about your firm unity in protecting them.
This is natural, as in the developing society violations are frequent. I am glad that those people, who will be responsible of protecting our citizens, will receive their professional knowledge in this training center.
The cooperation between us will enable young attorneys to serve the main thing – the creation of the civil and democratic state, built based on the Supreme Law ", - stated the President.
The President has once again highlighted his support and respect to Georgian Bar Association.
"I will fully support the attorneys if any kind of pressure is exerted on them while executing their duties. I stand by your side and I am ready to make any appropriate political statements to fulfill our common duty.
My fundamental responsibility is to protect the Constitutional rights of Georgian citizens which you, in fact, exercise on your daily basis. I consider any form of pressure on attorneys as an infringement on the values that are protected by the Constitution”, - stated the President.
Georgian Bar Association has awarded the President with Luarsab Andronikashvili Order for his contribution in the development of the legal profession.
