SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG AT THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE SINGAPORE SPORTS SCHOOL ON FRIDAY, 2  APRIL 2004 AT 4.25 PM AT THE SINGAPORE SPORTS SCHOOL, 1  CHAMPIONS WAY
Singapore Sports School
Three years ago, the Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCDS) showed me its blueprint for a Sporting Singapore. I supported it. It was bold, with ambitious goals and concrete recommendations. Much has been achieved since then.
The Singapore Sports School is one of the bold initiatives we have implemented under the Sporting Singapore plan.
The launch of the Sports School is also a significant milestone in the remaking of Singapore. Last year, the Remaking of Singapore Committee recommended that we needed to "stretch" our education system so as to broaden the definition of talent to include non-traditional areas like sports and the arts. The Committee also proposed broadening the definition of success in our society. The Committee envisioned a remade Singapore that will provide rich opportunities for Singaporeans, beyond the academic route, to pursue their passion and dreams, express their diverse talents and realise their potential.
The Sports School is ground breaking because it broadens the definition of talent and success. It is also an incubator for our young budding athletes who are prepared to travel a new route to realise their own interests and potential.
With support from top-class coaches and advanced sports science services in the School, our athletes will have a better chance of becoming champions.
Champions are not born. They are made. Ask any champion and he will tell you that his achievement did not come easy. Albert Einstein said that "genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration". I would say that sports champions are "1 percent talent and 99 percent pain and perspiration".
Our budding sports men and sports women have both the determination and dedication. I am told that when the Sports School started selection trials last August, the response was overwhelming. 1200 students signed up but the School only took in 140.
It is not just the students who showed enthusiasm. The parents of this pioneer batch must also be commended for having the courage to allow their children to take the road less travelled.
MCDS told me that the Sports School has designed a flexible curriculum to help its students achieve a balance between sports and studies. This gives our young the opportunity to succeed in sports, without sacrificing an academic education. Some may think it strange that a Sports School should be concerned about academic studies. Some commentators have argued that the School should just concentrate on sports. I don�t believe this is the right approach.
To be a champion, you need to have a good mind. Whether it is soccer or tennis or golf, you need to think clearly and strategically to outwit your opponent and win the game. Some of the world's best sportsmen and sportswomen are people with sound intellect. They could easily have made it in many other professions.
The Sports School must offer an avenue for our talented youth to reach the pinnacle of their sporting potential, and at the same time, prepare them for life. It must give them a balanced education. The primary objective of the Sports School is not to produce professional athletes who will make a living out of sports. It is to produce top athletes who will contribute to Singapore in different ways. If some of them can make Singapore proud by winning in international competitions, well and good. If not, they will still be able to build a career and contribute to society as good citizens, like everybody else.
This is also the case with most sports schools around the world. For every David Beckham and Tiger Woods who can make a comfortable living from winnings and endorsements, there are thousands of athletes who must go on to make a career in other ways. An academic education is important, as it gives them options. I am glad that the Sports School is providing its students with a good balance. Parents need not worry that their children will pay a price later on in life if they focus on sports now.
Currently, the Sports School provides its students with a secondary education. But it has been exploring post-secondary options. I am pleased to announce that the Sports School has reached an agreement with the Ministry of Education to facilitate a junior college education for its students.
When you came into the Sports School earlier, you might have noticed construction next door. This is for the new junior college which will open its doors in 2005. It will enable students to combine high-level sports training with a junior college education. The approach to teaching the �A� level curriculum would be conceptually similar to what is being provided by the Sports School today. It must be flexible enough so that the students can continue with intensive training without missing out on a good education. The students will continue to live and train at the Sports School and take their classes next door.
The Sports School is also discussing with other educational institutions like the polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education to work out other post-secondary arrangements. Such arrangements will provide more opportunities for our promising athletes to continue their education and sports training and achieve a happy balance between sports and studies.
Other Major Milestones In Sports Since 2001
Let me now turn to other major developments in sports over the past few years. I am pleased that we are beginning to put in place more systems and processes to realise our sporting plan.
National Sports Associations
The National Sports Associations (NSAs) are the engines driving our sports delivery system. To power these engines, the Government, through the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), has provided them with higher levels of grants and helped them with strategic planning.
However, to function effectively, these engines need regular maintenance. The Singapore Sports Council has introduced the Code of Governance for NSAs to ensure that they develop a more representative leadership structure, better financial management and transparent selection systems.
This is a good move. I understand most NSAs today are better managed and have comprehensive plans to develop our athletes. I encourage more NSAs to come forward to work with the Sports Council, comply with the Code of Governance and develop their strategic plans.
Sports for All
Recently, Dr Yaacob mentioned in Parliament that the Singapore Sports Council will be taking a different approach to building and operating its sports facilities. The SSC is working closely with other partners, including schools and grassroots organisations, to open up existing playing fields and develop new ones. These are cost-effective measures to multiply our sports facilities. We should come up with more of these creative approaches.
Sports Industry
The past three years have also seen an increase in the number of major international sports events being held in Singapore. The Caltex Masters Golf Tournament and International Marathon are two such examples. These events contribute to our sports culture, add to Singapore�s colourful events calendar and help establish us as a world-class sporting venue.
This week alone, sports fans can enjoy two world-class events in Singapore. The Japan-Singapore FIFA World Cup qualifier was held two days ago and the International Rugby Sevens will start tomorrow. While on this, let me say that our National soccer team put up a superb performance last Wednesday. To the Lions, I say, "Well done and keep it up!" The increasing numbers of prestigious sporting events that we are bringing to Singapore reinforce the need for good sports infrastructure. World-class athletes and international fans demand high standards. The Government has therefore approved the rebuilding of the National Stadium into a new Sports Hub at Kallang. This will be the new centrepiece of our sporting landscape - an icon for the nation, a sporting hub for the people and a world-class venue for events.
MCDS is exploring a fundamentally different approach in building the Sports Hub. To make it an exciting lifestyle hub, MCDS is engaging private sector partners to see how they can play a role.
Conclusion
Over the last 3 years, we have laid a good foundation for our sports development. The Government will continue to play its part. Likewise, members of the sporting fraternity must continue to work together as Team Singapore. If we work in partnership, I am confident that we can turn Singapore into a sporting nation.
I strongly believe that sports has a crucial role in our nation and society. Sports can entertain, excite and bond a nation. It forges a strong Singapore spirit. We feel a sense of bonding when we support our athletes at international competitions. Whenever a Singapore athlete mounts the winner�s rostrum and the national anthem is played, we all feel proud.
Sports also fosters a "can do" quality in our people. Sports men and sports women succeed because of their passion and drive. They serve as good role models for our youth. The history of Singapore is a story about the constant struggle against overwhelming odds. The "can do" spirit has been the single most important factor for our survival and success.
To you, the 140 boys and girls of the pioneer batch of the Sports School, the road ahead will be challenging. You are privileged to be part of the pioneer batch of students. You are brave to follow your passion and pursue your dreams. I hope that you will give of your best in both sports and studies. The education you receive on the playing field may be lessons which cannot be taught in the classroom.
Remember, sports is not just about winning. Sports is about dedication and determination to do your best. If your best is better than anyone else�s, congratulations, you are a champion. But if you lose, even when you play at your absolute best, that is hard. You will no doubt feel disappointed. But if you learn a lesson from your loss, and are the stronger for it, you have not lost. In a sense, you are embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Whether you win or lose, what is crucial is for each of you to say that I have given my best to something I believe in, and that I am a better person for it.
And to Singaporeans at large, I have this message - make sports a part of your life. You do not have to be in the Sports School to enjoy or excel in your favourite sport. Playing sports is a good way to keep fit and stay healthy. It helps to build friendships and social bonds. In that sense, sports is an important pillar of our vision to make Singapore a strong, vibrant and dynamic nation.
Thank you.
