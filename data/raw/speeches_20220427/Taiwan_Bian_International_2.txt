Body of the speech


  首先要感謝美國企業研究院以「聯合國與台灣民主」為題，於華府和台北同步舉行這一場視訊會議，相信透過持續溝通與意見交換，一定能讓美國的朋友及國際社會，更瞭解「以台灣的名義加入聯合國」所代表的意涵，以及「入聯公投」與深化台灣民主的關連性與必要性。
於去年的9月13日，當聯合國總務委員會再次否決我參與聯合國的提案，本人曾明確的指示：「面對連續14年的叩關挫敗，我們必須認真思考未來是不是應該採取不同的策略來爭取台灣參與聯合國的權利。」今年7月20日本人致函聯合國潘基文秘書長，正式以台灣的名義申請加入聯合國。過去雖然一再強調要參與聯合國，但台灣方面卻從不曾正式提出申請，今年我們決定改變策略，不只要爭取成為聯合國的正式會員國，同時要以台灣的名義、以一個新會員國的身分申請加入聯合國。


台灣不是中華人民共和國的一部分，台灣是一個主權獨立的國家，國家的主權屬於二千三百萬台灣人民，這是歷史的事實也是台海的現狀，不需要由任何人來告訴我們台灣是不是一個國家。同時，台灣與中華人民共和國是兩個互不隸屬、各自獨立的主權國家，也就是說「海峽兩岸、台灣中國、一邊一國」。


1971年10月25日所通過的聯合國第2758號決議文，其中只提到：「決定恢復中華人民共和國的一切權利，承認它的代表為中國在聯合國組織的唯一合法代表。立即趕出蔣介石在聯合國組織及其所屬機構內的代表，…」，全篇決議文完全不曾提及「台灣」這兩個字，也從來不曾確立台灣係中華人民共和國之一省，或接受中華人民共和國對台灣擁有主權的主張。因此，中華人民共和國無權也無法在聯合國代表二千三百萬的台灣人民，台灣人民有權要求在聯合國要有適當的代表，更有權要求以平等的地位申請成為聯合國的會員國。


依據聯合國憲章及安全理事會與大會的議事規則，台灣的入會申請案應由安全理事會與大會來審議。不能因為中國的反對、杯葛與打壓，就漠視台灣做為一個主權國家的事實，更不能因為聯合國秘書處的違法濫權而剝奪了二千三百萬台灣人民應有的基本人權。本人由衷的期盼全世界愛好自由、民主，崇尚人權、公義與和平的國家，在即將召開的聯合國大會能夠仗義執言，讓台灣的入會申請案得到公平審議的機會。


半個多世紀以來，中國始終不放棄以武力犯台併吞台灣的野心。近年來更不斷增加部署於東南沿海瞄準台灣的戰術導彈，至今總數已達到988枚，且以每年120至150枚的速度持續增加。中國人民解放軍並已完成對台作戰三階段準備任務，明確訂定於2007年前，全面形成應急作戰能力；2010年前，具備大規模作戰能力；2015年前，具備決戰決勝能力。同時，於2005年3月14日更不顧國際社會一致的反對，一意孤行通過所謂的「反分裂國家法」，為武力犯台提供所謂的法源依據。而過去的一年，中國更強力施壓聯合國秘書處要求發表「台灣為中華人民共和國一部分」的錯誤主張，企圖片面改變台海的現狀，並全面封鎖台灣的國際生存空間。


過去為了參與聯合國，我們對名稱的選擇與參與的方式上始終自我限縮。然而，事實證明委屈不但不能求全，反而招致更蠻橫無情的打壓。迫使我們不得不認真思考，改弦更張，直接以台灣的名義申請加入聯合國，除了要彰顯台灣是一個主權國家的事實外，更要積極捍衛台海的現狀不被中國片面改變。


台灣做為地球村的一份子、身為全球民主社群的一員，我們非常清楚當前的國際現實，深切的瞭解對絕大多數的國際社會，中華民國意味著對中華人民共和國合法性的質疑與否定。以中華民國的名義要求重返聯合國，等於要求中華人民共和國將其聯合國的席次還給中華民國，再次反映了國共之間「漢賊不兩立」的舊思維，不但昧於現實，更是無知與不智。今天我們以台灣的名義、以一個新會員國的身分申請加入聯合國，表示我們無意挑戰聯合國第2758號決議文、更無意與中華人民共和國爭所謂的「中國代表權」，展現台灣在爭取參與國際社會時務實且負責任的態度。


聯合國自1945年成立以來，始終是人類謀求和平、捍衛自由最偉大的創建。六十多年來，聯合國對所有的國家不論面積大小、人口多寡、發展與否，一概予以熱情的接納、誠摯的擁抱，申請加入聯合國從來不曾被認為是挑釁的行為，唯獨台灣始終被排除在聯合國的大門之外。本人相信這絕對不是聯合國或國際社會在排擠台灣，而是因為中國的因素，因為中國蠻橫無理的打壓、杯葛與抵制，使台灣無法成為聯合國的會員國，並讓聯合國所揭櫫的會籍普遍化原則淪為空談。


經過兩次世界大戰的慘痛教訓，世界各國好不容易透過聯合國所建立起來的集體安全機制，讓人類享有一段最長時期的和平與繁榮。當戰爭的陰影逐漸從文明歷史中消失的時候，聯合國這個和平的殿堂絕對不能淪為惡棍橫行與叫囂的舞台。今天只因為中國的軍事要脅與武力威嚇就將台灣排除於聯合國體系之外、剝奪了二千三百萬台灣人民享有集體安全的基本人權，我們不禁要問下一步會是什麼？歷史的殷鑑不遠，姑息只會養奸，而綏靖更是邁向戰爭最短的捷徑。


各位在美國華府的好朋友，長期以來，台灣與美國始終是自由與民主的價值同盟，更是捍衛亞太地區安全、和平與穩定最忠實的戰略伙伴。雖然彼此對以台灣的名義加入聯合國及入聯公投等議題有不同的立場與主張，但不應損及台美兩國人民深厚的友誼，相信透過坦誠友好的溝通，必能化解相互的歧見，為自由、民主、人權、和平與公義等共同信仰繼續攜手奮鬥。


  最後，本人要引用紐約百老匯音樂劇「夢幻騎士」其中一首非常有名的歌曲「不可能的夢」(The Impossible Dream) ，來表達台灣人民渴望加入聯合國的意志與決心，同時也代表本人此刻的心情。
這一首歌是這樣寫的：「要敢夢不可能實現的夢，要敢對抗無法擊敗的敵人，忍受那無法忍受的苦楚，奔向那勇者不敢前去的地方，改正那無法改正的錯誤，追求遠方的純潔與高雅。」


「當雙臂疲累不堪時，更要試著去靠近那遙不可及的星星。這是我的追求，不論希望多麼渺茫、不管目標多麼遙遠，我將毫無遲疑的為正義而戰，為神聖的使命而奮不顧身。」


「我知道只要堅持對此榮耀的追求，當我躺下之時我心將永享寧靜，世界也因此變得更好，受到輕視且滿身傷痕的人們，為追求那遙不可及的星星，將依然全力奮戰直到耗盡所有的勇氣。」


以台灣的名義加入聯合國，雖是自由民主的台灣與極權獨裁的中國，兩者之間的角力與競爭，但也是國際社會公理與強權之間的鬥爭。堅持走對的路、做對的事，光明與良善終將戰勝黑暗與邪惡，也將為全人類，包括13億的中國人民，帶來永久的和平、自由、繁榮與幸福。


再次感謝美國企業研究院的邀請與參與，敬祝各位佳賓、先進和朋友，身體健康、萬事如意。


其他人的评论：Comments by other participants


隨後，參與視訊會議的學者專家分別發表看法，與總統進行意見互動。與會者發言內容為：
  卜大年(主持人)：
  我是卜大年，今天我們真的找到了經驗非常豐富，無論是在學術界或在政策制訂的領域，都有相當豐富經驗的與談人，能夠來此發言，同時請教陳總統問題。總統手上有各位與談人的簡歷，所以待會我們每位與談人有5到7分鐘的時間發言，如果他們有問題，我們也會敦請陳總統先生在五位與談人講完之後再一併回答。隨後，我們會請現場的來賓發問。首先，請眾議員羅拉巴克先生發言。


羅拉巴克眾議員：
  陳總統，早安，很抱歉，我本來希望你能夠為我們唱剛剛致詞所提的那首歌，或者下一次我看到你的時候，可能會請你唱這首歌。我想，真的不可能的夢，是台灣人民應該要有所有自由人民所擁有的一個權利，不可能的夢也就是，在北京的共產黨獨裁政權，不但認為他們能夠把他們的主權建在不希望成為中國一部份的台灣人民身上，同時也認為他們能夠維持他們這種獨裁的力量，對中國人民的統治力量，這才是不可能的夢。最終，不只是台灣的人民能夠擁有自由選擇是否想要獨立的權利，而中國的人民在最後也應該能夠有自由去選擇他們的政府。我要在此恭喜您以及台灣的人民有這樣的勇氣，能夠對抗中國這樣一個霸道的政權，能夠堅持你們自己的權利，能夠相信自由，相信人民、全世界的人民都有權擁有天賦的人權，我們站在你的一方，我們也站在台灣人民的一方，他們才是決定他們主權到底屬於誰的這群人，而不是北京的霸道政權強加在他們身上的意志。很遺憾的是，聯合國的秘書長似乎忘卻了這樣一個法則，就是他們應該遵循的一個法則，這是我們對待霸道的政權，像北京這樣一個政權所犯的一個錯誤。聯合國秘書長並沒有權利來決定台灣是不是中國的一部分，我完全支持您的論點。這是聯合國秘書長超出了職權範圍來做出他宣稱的這樣一個宣言。當然台灣的人民有權利來申請加入聯合國，尤其，當台灣人民以公投來決定他們是不是希望能夠這麼做，他們有權來申請加入聯合國，而這樣一個申請的行為，也被視為以聯合國的規則來加入的，所以我們認為北京政權的干預違反了聯合國的規則，我們不能讓他們得逞。我也看到聯合國在過去的一些記錄上，有類似這樣的情況，總統先生剛才也提到，多年以來，聯合國當中代表中國的席位，是被一個獨裁的政府所控制，這個獨裁的政權，蔣介石的政權，事實上並不能代表中國的人民也不能代表台灣的人民，這點是大家需要體認的。所以，聯合國在當時並沒有體認到真正代表中國的政府為何，而現在，他們也不想體認代表台灣執政的政府，承認台灣真正的政府，所以我們可以看到聯合國有這種忽視事實的歷史紀錄。台灣事實上有權利宣稱他們自己擁有這樣的主權，像全世界的每一個人都能夠有權透過投票方式來決定他們的命運。我們不應該在這些恃強凌弱的人面前示弱。那中國政府，事實上他們自己的人民都沒有投票的權利，所以他們做為一個真正政府的威信也值得懷疑。我也開始跟我的一些同事來抵制北京的奧運，陳總統，我在此跟您公開的提出，希望您能夠加入我們，不要以台灣的名義派奧運代表團到北京，同時，加入我們一起抵制北京奧運的行動。我們抵制奧運是因為共產黨對世界和平的威脅，人權受到損害。有很多人相信，世界將會變得更加的和平，他們也透過投票的方式在決定台灣的人民是不是有權決定他們是不是中國的一部分，這些人是以比較懦弱的方式，認為姑息養奸可以維護區域和平。我想我們都瞭解，如果台灣人民輸了，屈服於中國政府，也就是他們不相信的這個政府，我相信這只會是第一步而已，因為中國的說法，他擁有領土的權力，而不是人民的權力，權力是在人民的身上，領土並沒有這樣的權力。如果我們承認了這一點，讓北京政權透過武力的方式來施壓，來達成他的目標，達成領土主權的宣稱，我們看到的將不會是個更為和平的世界。相反的，北京將會在區域當中去擴張領土，包括俄羅斯、印度，還有南中國海，進一步去擴張他的版圖，這樣的作法只會造成更多的衝突。如果我們對領土主權的伸張比人民決定他們自己主權更為重要的話，顯然是錯誤的。所以我們原則上絕對是支持陳總統的，我們也希望在實務層面來說，台灣人民也不應放棄，應堅持到底。你們所堅持的不是一個不可能的夢想，而是所有崇尚自由人民的夢想。就像美國一樣，在過去200多年，我們追求天賦人權的自由，而只有透過人民賦予這樣的權力，才能達成這樣的意義，我想在台灣人民也是有這樣的願望。我們恭祝總統在這方面有順利的進展。


坎博博士：
  我也要表達我個人的看法。在亞洲的政策部分，尤其是在台灣，我想到另外一齣百老匯音樂劇「貓」，大家若記得它的台詞的話：「在午夜的街上沒有任何聲音」，對我來說，我看到這些帶著善意的人們，事實上也受到這種阻礙，同時我們今天在此，對美國來說我們都忽略很多在亞洲的利益，把注意力都放在中東問題上，我們在亞洲部分作得很差，我想這也是美國下一任總統必須要重視的重要議題。我們必須重新平衡，要注重亞洲。我們今天在這裡，可看到一項重要的對話，就是APEC的部分，事實上美國在這一部分並沒有特別強調我們對亞洲的支持。在過去幾年來，我們事實上並沒有太多時間來參與APEC的會議，包括萊斯取消很多議程，布希總統也是如此，所以縮短APEC議程，提早返國。美國把重點過度放在伊拉克上，所以沒有時間去型塑亞洲在未來的發展，前舒茲國務卿先前把亞洲政策比喻成園藝，像在照顧花園一樣，要時時的注意，時時的照顧，我們現在就沒有作到這一點。目前民主黨與共和黨都把重點放在中東問題上面，我想亞洲事務非常多樣，而我們沒有花足夠的注意力在這上頭。再者，我非常同意剛才狄繆思院長提到的一點，不過陳總統在用詞上面非常謹慎，他說他被美國外交事務人員批評，這部分不是屬於布希政府，我想我們必須瞭解，批評的人是布希政府底下的人，我想最重要的事情就是要能去重新平衡，也就是所謂政府當中權力的問題，我希望國會能在這些問題上扮演更積極的角色。對不起，雖然眾議員在場，我還是要說國會在這一部分並沒有盡到它的責任。我們必須要進一步了解我們對亞洲事務有什麼期望？第三點，就是我們彙總了我們在過去從2001年以來傳遞給台灣的訊息，迄今，我們都沒有公開感謝陳總統及台灣，在伊拉克及阿富汗議題所給予我們的支持，台灣是第一個提出支持我們政策的國家之一。我們並沒有要求，台灣是自願表示支持，這點是我們要深表感謝之處。
  美國對台灣的基本政策好像是「我們支持你們的自由，我們也會協助保護你們，但我們實在太繁忙，世界上有太多的事情，我們不要你們因細故而大事紛擾，而你們也不要為我們製造問題」，這樣的論調從2001年起就開始出現。然而我覺得這樣的想法應該要有所改變了，也就是說我們對台灣的政策應該要重新省視，建立一個更有意義的基礎。
  我認為基於美國利益，台美應該增加對話與溝通，以避免誤解或雙方瞭解上的困難，我很訝異於台灣與美國華府間溝通的遲緩，我希望能以正面的角度來看待雙方關係，也就是說我們需要更有制度的觀點，來處理台灣海峽兩岸關係，同時支持台灣這樣的一個朋友。
  最後，我想請教總統一個問題，也再度感謝您撥冗與我們對談，近日有那一個亞太國家私底下與您溝通過、給予您支持，或提供任何建議嗎？方才羅拉巴克眾議員的某些論點我很贊同，尤其是關於聯合國潘基文秘書長的一番談話，他的確是逾越自己職權了。


葛林博士：
  自由貿易協定對雙邊都有利。尤其自由貿易協定對東南亞自由經濟扮演非常重要的角色。當然，台灣也希望能加入亞洲貿易事務當中，我們必須有進一步對話，國會也曾提議讓更高層次官員訪問台灣，但我想更重要的是讓跟政策制定有關的人士作更進一步、開放的討論。我相信我們在推廣民主方面能有更進一步的協助。台灣在對外援助花費很多，這部分我相信能作進一步會談，這部分美國倘多關注，對我們來說是有益的。
  另一方面，我們亦需瞭解，台灣的身分問題不只是政治問題，也不只是台灣在戰略上的一些動作。基本上，它是非常基本的生存問題。如果去看韓國、日本，國家認同問題均是亞洲國家重要的議題之一，台灣亦無不同。美國政府與學界都應體認到這點，不要一直把它看成是政治上的動作，因為這對台灣來說是非常基本的問題，美國在這當中也有相關的利益，所以也應該要慎加考量。在台灣的部分，我們也應去思考強化支持台灣民主方面的議題。事實上，台灣擁有非常好的友邦，在華府、亞洲其他地區、歐洲、日本都有非常支持台灣的友人。我想台灣的任何議題都需要去鞏固這些友好的關係、人脈，同時把這些關係進一步聚集在一起，這部分能提升台灣的國家安全，同時我們也能仔細去思考一些議題，像以台灣名義申請加入聯合國等等。當然這是一個非常複雜的議題，重點不只是在穩定、安定上，同時，在台灣的民主方面，我們必須要想到以最好的方式來達成這樣的目標。同時台灣與美國、日本等友邦應該進一步鞏固關係。當然，像這樣的與談也是非常重要的。很多人忽略中國的武力威脅及「反分裂國家法」代表的意涵，還有聯合國秘書長潘基文的發言造成的後果，我們應協助台灣人民來改正這些問題。


王維正副教授：
  陳總統，您好，我是在高雄出生、長大，雖然我只在視訊會議上看到你，沒有見到你本人，還是有回家的感覺。我同意坎博博士與葛林博士的說法，即在美國與台灣之間，我們應該有更多實質、正面的對話。我也同意葛林博士的說法，即瞭解台灣國內政治，將會有助於美國去瞭解台灣的民主，尤其是改善雙邊的關係。另外，我要跟大家分享我個人的一些感受，尤其台灣在國際參與方面的活動。大概在13年前，我寫了一篇文章，就是關於台灣加入聯合國的相關議題。在這篇文章當中，我提到六個不同模式。就是台灣可以用不同的方式，譬如說以反駁決議文方式來加入聯合國；或是以平行加入模式，即德國與韓國加入的方式；另外就是ADPA模式，即一個中國一個台灣模式；及蘇聯模式，即一個國家有數個席位的模式；最後是越南模式，即一個統一的國家，一個席位的方式。顯然，1993年以來至今，台灣的政府在加入聯合國的方式上較猶豫不定，今年台灣採取了一個新的模式。
  我在2年前寫了一篇文章，關於台灣在國際參與能夠建立一個新的模式，它有一些基本的概念：第一就是在全球化的時代，功能性已經取代了主權，台灣功能的重要性在國際社會能夠扮演一個重要的角色。我在這個模式當中也提到4點，也想請教陳總統第一點就是，把台灣的國際政府組織的參與跟外交承認分開，也就是說我們重視台灣加入國際組織的價值，但是不挑戰中共對台灣地位的看法，希望能夠讓台灣在國際組織當中能夠有一個有意義的代表；第二部分就是在憲章方面，這些國際組織只承認有主權的國家，所以讓他們也能夠承認在功能上面符合資格的一個單位，尤其是在特定的領域，例如在金融、人權、漁業等層面，就是各會員只給予主權國家跟在某方面具有功能完全性的國家，就是在台灣加入國際組織的部分，對中國的代表主權或暗示台灣的一個主權獨立的情況，但這樣的一個作法，也並不阻礙其他的會員來承認台灣，最後在這些文件當中強調，如果台灣宣布獨立的話，會失去這些組織的會員資格，這個部分也是要去強調台灣的承諾，以及希望能夠在這些國際組織當中能夠有意義的代表權的原因，但是基本上又不會去踩到主權的問題。我想最後請教總統2個問題，第一個，我們知道美國一直非常支持台灣，有些台灣人認為美國可以作得更多，不過在國際參與的部分，在過去，美國的支持非常重要，尤其是在APEC或是在世界貿易組織的加入方面，當然台灣加入的時候中國還不是這2個組織的會員，在當時2個條件是，台灣和中國同時加入，或者是中國不在台灣之前加入。美國支持台灣似乎是個固定的模式，在未來的參與方面是不是還必須遵循一樣的模式。我的問題是，您有什麼明確的步驟來修復美台之間的關係，就像剛剛坎博博士和葛林博士所提到的，您對下一任美國總統不論是共和黨或是民主黨的候選人獲勝有什麼樣的期許。


施密特博士：
  謝謝陳總統，陳總統晚安，當你剛剛提到夢幻騎士的那首歌時，我也想到另外一首歌，歌詞是：「你不見得永遠能夠得到你想要的東西，但是只要你嘗試，你會得到你需要的東西」，這是滾石合唱團的歌曲，而事實上我也蠻喜歡這首歌的。首先我要提到一點，就是剛剛提到我們似乎在外交上面碰到一些問題，我想在目前情況之下，美國對台灣公投的決定非常的重視，我們也非常注意台海兩岸緊張的關係。台北、北京和華府之間都非常注意這個議題，但是我也很驚訝所有的焦點都在台灣的動作上面。剛剛你也提到台灣的作法和期望，在這個部分我們看到中國卻完全反其道而行，持續以武力威脅台灣，以非和平的手段，對台灣施加動作，事實上如果像法國或歐洲其他國家有同樣的作法，大家會覺得非常震驚，但是大家對於中國這樣的一個作法，卻彷彿好像是理所當然，這點是非常需要注意的，另外就是，美國必須要承認台灣在這方面所作的努力，我們可以看到國務院的回應，尤其是對聯合國秘書長發言的回應，就是我們必須要對台灣是否為中國的一部分要做出正面的回應，在這個部分是我們特別要注意的，第二點，從美國的一個中國政策來說，台灣加入聯合國對一個中國政策並不會有重大影響。我們也瞭解聯合國的態度，之前北韓及東德加入聯合國情況類似，聯合國2758號決議文並未反對或禁止台灣加入聯合國。事實上，聯合國中許多國家並不是用正式名稱，例如馬其頓等，所以使用台灣名稱加入聯合國也不應被拒絕。最後，我們應思考，美國現任政府在處理台灣問題上未做到應盡的責任，美國未全力支持台灣加入世界衛生組織，也未支持台灣簽署自由貿易協定。聯合國秘書長的發言，美國的回應也不是那麼恰當，台灣想透過公民投票來決定未來，卻得到曲解，這部分是我要強調的。


總統回應：
非常感謝各位與談人剛才所做的報告，有很多非常寶貴的意見。首先對於羅拉巴克眾議員提到，要跟同僚一起抵制2008年的北京奧運，台灣有權加入聯合國，而且認為過去蔣介石政權並不代表中國人民及台灣人民。對於羅拉巴克眾議員提到要一起和同僚抵制2008年的北京奧運，也希望台灣方面不要派出奧運代表團，在此我必須要再次強調，因為我們所關心的是在整個奧運的參與，特別台灣的奧運代表團參加北京奧運，我們不希望看到台灣被矮化，特別是有關聖火的來台，也不應該利用這樣的體育盛事，把它泛政治化，甚至把它作為統戰的工具，這一點我們非常的努力，也非常的有誠意，在我國的奧委會跟對岸的北京奧委會，一直在作非常坦誠的溝通，我們希望問題能夠化解，我們歡迎北京奧運的聖火能夠來到台灣，但是前提就是台灣絕對不應該受到矮化，這是非常重要的。當然我們也非常感謝羅拉巴克眾議員給我們很大的鼓舞，而且也希望台灣能夠堅持下去，因為台灣堅持的不是不可能實現的夢想，我們也是這樣的認為只要作對的事、走對的路，終有一天我們一定會成功。


我們也感謝坎博博士提到的問題，美國注意的焦點不應只放在中東，而忽略亞洲，亞洲議題也不應只鎖定朝鮮半島，台海的問題仍應兼顧，台灣問題不是只有海峽對岸中國的問題，台灣2300萬人民也是布希總統政府重視的民主社群的一份子，也希望受到平等對待，坎博博士特別提出平衡的問題，注意的焦點應平衡，如美國行政部門向中國傾斜，國會也應站出來扮演應扮演的角色，盡應盡的責任，這一點提醒彌足珍貴，希望共同勉勵。


台灣好像長期被美國視為乖寶寶、聽話的好學生，但不應該因為台灣是美國最忠實的友邦，在很多面向與美國政府與人民永遠站在一起，美國就視為理所當然而忽略台灣的需求，所以很多事情被忽略了，但是否因為這十幾年來台灣太聽話、太配合，這點讓我們午夜夢迴，捫心自問，哪裏出了問題？


另外感謝葛林博士提到實質對話，台美是忠實友邦，雙方應有實質對話，我們非常懷念與肯定葛林博士擔任國家安全會議主任及資深主任期間，兩國關係非常友好密切，主要是因為我們有非常好的溝通管道與高層實質對話，這些是現在沒有的，我們不知是哪一位做的決定？我們曾一再呼籲應強化兩國高層對話，不是交由國務院或台北美國在台協會處長負責就是兩國最好的溝通管道，好多問題之所以成為問題，可能就是這個原因，由於沒有高層實質對話、接觸溝通管道，讓許多問題產生不必要的歧見與誤會，好比說美國行政部門友人認為台灣入聯問題及公投議題是陳水扁一個人的意思，要求我站出來發揮影響力，以為只要我公開反對，入聯公投就會被打消，一再要對我施壓。美國既然支持台灣民主，就應支持台灣民主多元聲音，所以有人認為應以台灣名義加入聯合國，不要自欺欺人，重蹈覆轍，過去台灣不論用中華民國的名義重返聯合國或用中華民國（台灣）名義參與聯合國，事實證明過去十幾年我們都錯了，我們希望調整加入聯合國策略，也希望就此和美國溝通，請不要以為這是我一人的意思，而是台灣2300萬絕大多數民眾的共同心聲。做為民主國家的總統，我不可能違背民意、漠視民意，我相信布希總統非常清楚，民主國家非常重視民意。當聯合國秘書長說台灣是中國的一部分，這是與事實不符，與2758號決議文完全不容，聯合國2758號決議文完全沒提到台灣，怎麼會擴張解釋為台灣是中華人民共和國的一部分？所以感謝美國政府後來也注意到，此點與美國一個中國政策完全不符合，這也是我們要表達衷心感謝的地方。既然美國認為維持台海現狀是美國的利益，也是2300萬台灣人民共同的利益，所以應坐下來好好對話，如果中國主張台灣是中國的一省，或是中國的一部分，是否考慮就把台灣送給中國，乾脆投降算了，這樣，我們也不必有軍購不軍購的問題，我們也不需擔心中國的打壓，我們很清楚，美國不可能會同意，既然捍衛台海現狀是台美共同的利益，所以我們不接受台灣是中華人民共和國的一部分，這樣台灣難道錯了嗎？為何不能好好溝通，為何要以那樣的方式傷害台灣人民的心。


另外，我們非常感謝王教授剛才的問題。大家都瞭解，如果沒有美國政府的支持，沒有美國政府的協助，台灣不可能成為WTO第144個會員體，而且跟中國加入WTO只差非常短的時間，如果沒有美國政府的支持，我們是不可能入會成功的，這是一個鐵的事實。一樣的，APEC非正式經濟領袖會議，這幾天要在澳洲雪梨召開，雖然本人仍不能親自與會，仍然必須要派出領袖的代表—台灣的特使，這對台灣來講當然是非常不公平的事情，但是我們也願意來配合，我們也願意來忍受。我們還是必須感謝美國的支持，台灣才能成為APEC正式的會員體。在WHO方面，很清楚地，美國支持台灣能夠成為WHA的觀察員，雖然用衛生實體的名義，我們也願意委曲求全，但是11年過去了，我們並沒有成功。兩年前，說要給台灣有意義的參與WHO，但事實證明，2005年的7月，中國衛生部與WHO的秘書處，簽了秘密的MOU，結果又把台灣矮化了，變成它的地方政府。我們覺得，有意義的參與變成沒有意義的參與，美國政府給我們很大的關切，也希望能夠幫台灣的忙，但是，11年的時間在我任內已經有了7年的慘痛教訓，如果你是台灣的總統，如果你是台灣的政府，如果你是台灣的人民，是不是還要再繼續的忍耐下去？我們難道不希望能表達我們的心聲？確實我們已經等了太久了，還要再繼續地等下去嗎？當然，我們也覺得，不管是共和黨或者民主黨在明年當選美國的新總統，希望大家對台灣的支持都是一樣的。而且，我只有一個期許，不希望任何一個政府一定要對台灣留一手。我記得在老布希總統最後的一年才決定賣給台灣F16戰鬥機，雖然是F16AB型，但是我們都已經非常高興，如果真的要賣，認為強化台灣的國防那麼樣的重要，台灣的需求早就提出，為什麼一定要等到任內的最後一年才批准？一樣的道理，我們認為，即將卸任的布希總統，我們所獲悉的消息，我們好不容易已經爭取到F16CD型的國防預算，在立法院要爭取支持是不容易的事情，已經給我們經費，希望我們在10月底拿到美方的要價書，但是我們發現布希政府好像準備把它拖到明年520之後，新總統誕生，再來批准。如果認為強化台灣的國防是那麼重要，要協助台灣強化自我防衛的能力是那麼重要，如果明年就可以批准，為什麼現在不能同意。所以我們希望不管哪一個政黨來執政，希望對台灣的支持不要有任何的保留。這是我個人的淺見，也提出來跟大家互相勉勵。


當然，對施密特博士的建言和高見，我們都非常的感激。其中特別提到，要申請加入聯合國，不一定要用真正的國號，我們發現在190幾個聯合國的會員國當中，就有大概百分之40的會員國，他們參加聯合國的名義，並不是他們真正的國號。所以台灣入聯用「台灣」的名義，當然不涉及到國號的改變，所以沒有違背我對布希總統、對美國政府、對國際社會一再宣示的「四不保證」，這是一個事實，當然也就沒有所謂違反過去的保證，甚至說這是改變台海的現狀。剛才施密特博士特別提到，應該注意到國務院對於UN秘書長潘基文他的說法的一些回應。其實美國政府這樣做是對的，但是我們也不希望遮遮掩掩，對台灣有意見就公開的批評，公開的反對，但是對中國一些問題的講話跟主張，如果有意見的話，那可能是在桌子底下、在暗處來表達不同的保留意見，我們認為這對兩岸來講是一種不同的處理，不同的對待，2300萬台灣人民也是看在眼裡，我們感受非常的深，我們希望能夠有一個公平的對待。費浩偉大使最近到台灣來，他是台灣關係法( TRA)的起草人，他也特別講到，根據美國的法律─台灣關係法，台灣就是一個國家，除了不能夠互派大使、設大使館之外，美國承認台灣是一個脫離中國以外的一個國家，而且他也認為，台灣依照美國的法律—台灣關係法，是被允許參加國際組織的，包括WHO，也包括UN，這是費浩偉大使昨天跟我見面，他的高見。我們非常的感謝。德不孤，必有鄰。感謝大家，謝謝﹗

在和與談學者專家進行熱烈討論後，總統接受現場媒體提問，答問內容如下：
  問一：請教總統，您提到F16戰機的部分，可否請總統說明愛國者三型飛彈軍購案，何以對台灣也是如此重要？
  問二：我想請教，「入聯公投」似乎只具象徵性意義，而卻換來美國與中國的批評或反對的聲浪，是否值得？
問三：我想請教，胡錦濤最近提到中國人民解放軍的角色，及「統一台灣」的說法，您對中國領導人對台灣的說法，有何意見？


總統回应：
強化台灣國防，提昇台灣自我防衛能力，這是我們的義務，也是我們的責任，因此，多年來我們沒有違背信諾，包括到2008年，我們希望台灣的國防預算能提高到佔GDP的3％，我們在2007年預算的編列是提高到GDP的2.85％。在新的年度我們目前籌編當中、要送到立法院的部分，也提昇了400億新台幣，目的就是希望能夠達到GDP的3％，這代表我們的意志和決心。


縱使過去的三大軍購案經布希總統一次批准，我們衷心銘感，但是卡在國會殿堂幾年的時間，我們也覺得非常抱歉，然而經過大家共同的努力，總算在今年的6、7月走出第一步，其中有關於愛國者二型飛彈的提昇、愛國者三型飛彈的添購，這些對強化台灣國防是非常必要的。


一樣地，想買F16C/D型的戰鬥機，最主要是因為我們F5系列型戰鬥機需要汰換，在這樣的空隙當中，我們希望以F16C/D型戰鬥機來作填補。立法院那麼多元的政治生態，最後能夠給予支持，是非常不容易的一件事情，我們希望能夠得到美方的重視以及正面的回應，讓我們好不容易得到的國防預算，不要在10月底被迫還要再繳回去。


其次，我們也了解到，「入聯公投」最主要是因為我們都了解到，大家都一直要求，有關於台海的歧見與爭端，應該透過對話、和平解決，包括有關於台海的現狀不應該受到片面的改變，那今天最明顯的方式、最和平的手段，當然一方面是對話、一方面是協商，另外一方面也絕不是只靠武器，最重要的是「價值」，是一個「民主的價值」，所以我們要避免台海現狀被片面改變、要避免台海的現狀被以武力犯台片面改變，或者因為有人要在聯合國提案、要片面改變台海的現狀、要把台灣變成中華人民共和國的一部分，來逾越聯合國2758號的決議文，如果是這樣的話，2,300萬的台灣人民必須要發聲，我們必須要把我們的想法能夠對外有所表示，我們不是用武力、我們不可能用軍事，我們是用愛和民主的選票，也就是「公民投票」。


對於台灣的未來、台灣的命運、特別是兩岸的關係，2,300萬台灣人民應該有表達意見的自由，甚至有向中國說「NO」的權利，這就是公投的由來，是它的正當性、是它的必要性，所以，必須要耐心的說明，並不是只有象徵性的意義，而是實質上我們認為有它的功能，也有它可以展現意義的地方。


更何況，在台灣內部，大家都了解，今天國家要安全，內部必須要團結，光是一個美國軍售台灣的議題，台灣內部就有那麼多不同的聲音，要不要買？要買多少？要不要給？要給多少？大家有不同的意見，為什麼？就是因為我們很多人認為，台灣到底是不是一個國家？我們要不要做好自我的防衛？還是我們乾脆就變成中國的一部分，不必有外交，也不必有國防，所以，根本就不必添購必要的防衛性武器。


今天好不容易有一個聯合國的議題，讓我們有一個交集，讓我們有一個最起碼的共識，台灣希望參與國際社會，能夠成為包括聯合國在內各國際組織的一員。所以，美國政府、美國人民及美國國會，應該給台灣更多的鼓勵與支持才對。這是避免台海現狀被片面改變最好的民主方式，沒有砲聲、也不用武力，用民主的選票我們就可以自我防衛，這是我必須要提出來的另外一點。


對於胡錦濤先生一再地宣稱，包括此次訪問澳洲，在與布希總統的雙邊對談中，我們瞭解到一些。我們還是要告訴全世界，台灣絕對不是中華人民共和國的一部份；台灣是台灣、中國是中國，台灣是一個主權國家，台灣的國家主權屬於2,300萬的台灣人民。台灣絕對不是第二個香港，當然台灣也不是中國台北。這不是我講的，這是2,300萬台灣人民多數的聲音。


今天如何具體展現出來？如果你不相信，你一直認為那是陳水扁的意見，那我們就透過一次的公民投票，讓全世界都聽得到，這是2,300萬人民，也許是60%、也許是70%的多數意見。讓全世界知道我們是一個國家，我們的領土範圍僅限於台、澎、金、馬，並不包含中國大陸，更不可能包括外蒙古。這是歷史的事實，也是現狀。


胡錦濤主席所說的論調，也許他有他的使命，可是聽在2,300萬人民的心坎裡，是不可能接受的。謝謝！

President Chen Shui-bian's Videoconference with Panelists at the American Enterprise Institute (1)
2007-09-06
Transcript of President Chen Shui-bian's Videoconference with Panelists at the American Enterprise Institute


Office of the President
Republic of China (Taiwan)
September 6, 2007


President of the American Enterprise Institute Christopher 


DeMuth: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome. My name is Chris DeMuth. I'm President of the American Enterprise Institute(AEI). This morning, AEI is honored and delighted to be hosting this talk by and dialogue with President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan. In Washington, this week, as most eyes are turned on the situation in the Middle East, an important and potentially very serious situation is developing in Asia. During the last several months, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has, in various steps and communications, revised the position of the United Nations to being that Taiwan is an integral part of the People's Republic of China (PRC). In part in response to this development and in part as a result of developments in Taiwan's democratic domestic politics, a referendum has been scheduled for next March, asking the Taiwanese people to express themselves on the proposition of whether Taiwan should apply for full membership in the United Nations under the name "Taiwan." This scheduled referendum has been sharply criticized by American diplomats, including Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte. It has been sharply criticized by senior officials in the People's Republic of China, and there has even been talk by some Chinese scholars and in some of the state-controlled newspapers of the use of non-peaceful measures in response to the scheduled referendum. Taiwan is a democracy. The referendum plays an important role, and has played an important role, in its democratic development not, as in the United States, to resolve particular, narrow policy questions, but as an expression of popular sentiment. To explain and discuss the thinking behind this referendum, President Chen will give a talk, speaking by satellite hook-up from Taipei. Following his talk, there will be a dialogue. We will hear first from the distinguished members of our panel, including Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, Kurt Campbell of the Center for a New American Security, Michael Green of the Center for Strategic & International Studies, Vincent Wang of the University of Richmond, Gary Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute. That portion of this morning’s symposium will be moderated by my colleague, Dan Blumenthal of AEI. Following these comments, we will have questions from the audience and President Chen has graciously agreed to—in fact this was one thing he wanted very much to do—to respond to the views of the panelists and to those that may be expressed by individuals in the audience.


May I ask you please to decommission all of your cell phones and personal devices? President Chen will speak in Chinese, we have simultaneous translation available at Channel 5 on your headsets. And with that, I ask everyone to give a warm welcome to Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian.


President Chen's opening remarks:


Mr. Christopher DeMuth, President of the American Enterprise Institute, Moderator Dan Blumenthal and the five distinguished panelists: Representative Dana Rohrabacher, co-chair of the House Taiwan Caucus, Dr. Michael Green, former Senior Director of the National Security Council, Dr. Kurt Campbell, President of the Center for a New American Security, Dr. Vincent Wang, Professor of the Department of International Studies at Richmond University, and Dr. Gary Schmitt, Director of Advanced Strategic Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, Representative Joseph Jawshieh Wu, Distinguished Guests and Friends. Good Morning!


First of all, I would like to thank the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) for holding this videoconference between Washington, DC and Taipei on the subject of "The United Nations and Taiwan Democracy." I believe that the continued communication and exchange of views will allow our American friends and the international community to better understand the implications of joining the United Nations (UN) under the name "Taiwan". It will also allow everyone to better understand the connection between, and the need for, a referendum on joining the United Nations and consolidating democracy in Taiwan.


On September 13, 2006, the General Committee of the United Nations once again turned down Taiwan's bid to participate in the UN. I made it clear then that we would have to seriously consider whether or not an alternative strategy was needed in order to secure our right to participate in the UN. On July 20 of this year, I formally submitted my country's application for UN membership under the name "Taiwan" to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In the past, despite having repeatedly emphasized our desire to participate in some capacity in the United Nations, we had never formally filed an application. This year, however, we decided to alter our strategy and not to again sell ourselves short. We not only want to apply for UN membership, we also want to do so under the name "Taiwan" and in the capacity of a new member state.


Taiwan is not part of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan is an independent sovereign country and its national sovereignty rests with the 23 million people of Taiwan. This is not only a fact, but it is also the status quo of the Taiwan Strait. There is no need for anybody to tell us whether or not Taiwan is a country. Moreover, Taiwan and PRC are two separate countries, each having independent sovereignty, neither exercises jurisdiction over the other. In other words, there is one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan on one side, and China on the other.


Regarding Resolution 2758, passed by the UN General Assembly on October 25, 1971, this resolution only "decides," and I quote, "to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place… [which they unlawfully occupy] at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it." The Resolution in its entirety never once mentions "Taiwan." Furthermore, it neither declares Taiwan to be a province of PRC, nor does it accept PRC's assertion of sovereignty over Taiwan. Hence, PRC has no right, and is in fact unable, to represent the 23 million people of Taiwan in the United Nations. It is the people of Taiwan who have the right to ask for appropriate representation in the UN, and it is the people of Taiwan who have even more of a right to request to apply for UN membership from a position of equality.


According to the UN Charter and the Rules of Procedure of the UN Security Council and the General Assembly, Taiwan's membership application should be reviewed and decided upon by the Security Council and General Assembly. The fact that Taiwan is a sovereign country must not be ignored simply based on China's opposition, suppression and boycotting of the issue. Moreover, the fundamental human rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan cannot be stripped away by the UN Secretariat's unlawful abuse of power. I sincerely hope that those countries that love freedom and democracy, and respect human rights, justice and peace, will speak out from a position of justice in the upcoming UN General Assembly, and allow Taiwan the opportunity to have its membership application reviewed fairly.


Over the past half-century, China has neither renounced the use of force against Taiwan nor given up its ambition to annex Taiwan. China continues to deploy ballistic missiles along its southeastern coast targeting Taiwan. The current number of these missiles stands at nearly one thousand, and is increasing by 120 to 150 missiles per year. China's People's Liberation Army has formulated a three-stage military plan for war against Taiwan. These three stages are: to establish combat capabilities for comprehensive contingency response by the end of this year; to build up combat capabilities for large-scale military engagement by 2010; and to ensure victory in a decisive battle by 2015. Furthermore, on March 14, 2005, despite the international community's unanimous opposition, China passed the so-called "Anti-secession Law" which supposedly lays the legal foundation for a military invasion of Taiwan. Over the last year, attempting to unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and constrict Taiwan's space on the international stage, China has further pressured the UN Secretariat to declare that Taiwan is part of PRC, a claim which is, in all reality, false.


In the past, we made compromises on the choice of name for application and method of participation. However, time has shown us that compromise fails to bring us satisfactory results and only leads to continued and relentless suppression. This situation forces us to seriously consider changing our policy and submitting future applications to join the UN under the name "Taiwan." Such actions not only reflect the fact that Taiwan is a sovereign country, but also stem from the general need to defend the status-quo of the Taiwan Strait from being unilaterally changed by China.


As a member of the global society and the democratic community, we understand very well that in reality the political term "Republic of China" was conceived to challenge and deny the legality of the "People's Republic of China." Therefore, applying to rejoin the UN under the name "Republic of China" would be the equivalent of asking the PRC to return its UN seat to us, the Republic of China. This would also resurrect the KMT's ignorant, unwise, unrealistic and obsolete stance that "gentlemen don't stand with thieves." Today, our application to join the UN as a new member under the name "Taiwan" reaffirms that we have no intention of challenging Resolution 2758, or of engaging in a fight with the PRC over "China's representation." In contrast, we hope to show the world that Taiwan is pragmatic and responsible in its desire to participate in the international community.


Established in 1945, the United Nations is the mankind's greatest achievement in the pursuit of peace and freedom. Over the past six decades, the UN has grown in an attempt to incorporate and embrace all nations with passion and sincerity, regardless of size, population or degree of economic development. Applying for UN membership is never seen as a provocative act, except in the sole case of Taiwan, which has been repeatedly shut out of the UN. I believe that Taiwan's preclusion was not initiated by the UN as a whole, or by the international community. Rather, it has been instigated by China. Due to China's ruthless suppression, obstruction and denial of Taiwan, we have been unable to become a UN member. This renders the UN's principle of universality an empty concept.


After two devastating world wars, the allied powers established the UN to serve as a collective security mechanism in hopes of paving the way for long-term peace and stability of the human society. The UN should not become a playground for rogue nations. If Taiwan is to be precluded from the UN and Taiwan's 23 million people are to be deprived of the basic human right to collective security merely because of China's military threats and intimidation, we cannot help but ask what is in store for us next. The lessons we learned in the past are not distant: silence over injustices spawns evil, and appeasement breeds aggression and creates the quickest shortcut to war.


Our dear friends in Washington, D.C.: for years, Taiwan and the United States have held an alliance based on the values of freedom and democracy, and acted as loyal strategic partners to defend security, peace, and stability in the Asia Pacific region. Of course, our stances on certain issues, such as using the name "Taiwan" to enter the UN and holding a referendum on the matter, may differ. However, by no means should these differences undermine the profound friendship between the peoples of Taiwan and the United States. I believe that, through candid and cordial dialogue, we can reconcile our differences in order to continue fighting for our shared belief in freedom, democracy, human rights, justice and peace.


At this point, I would like to quote a popular song, "The Impossible Dream," from the Broadway musical Man of La Mancha in order to express the determination and will of the people of Taiwan to join the United Nations—a sentiment that I share.


The song goes:


To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go


To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chase from afar
To try when your arms are too weary to reach the unreachable star


This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause


And I know if I'll only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm when I’m laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star


Our bid to join the United Nations with the name of "Taiwan" is not just a simple struggle or contest between a democratic, free Taiwan and a communist, authoritarian China. It is also a fight between justice and evil within the international community.  As long as we follow the path of justice, light and goodness will prevail over darkness and evil. Our commitment will also lead to permanent peace, freedom, prosperity and happiness for all mankind, including the 1.3 billion people of China.


In closing, I would like to once again thank the American Enterprise Institute for its gracious invitation, and the audience for participating in today's discussion. May each of you enjoy good health and every success! Thank you very much!




Comments by other participants:


DeMuth: I will turn the immediate proceedings over to Dan Blumenthal. Dan.


Dan Blumenthal, Resident Fellow at AEI: Thank you very much, Mr. President and Chris DeMuth. I can't think of a better panel to have today with more experience, both in scholarly and in the world of policymaking, to both comment and to ask questions of President Chen. You have all of their bios, they've been introduced to you briefly. We're going to ask them to speak or ask questions for five to seven minutes each. If they do have questions, we're going to ask President Chen to wait till the end of the panel to respond to those questions, after which we will turn to the audience as well. We're gonna go down from left to right with Congressman Dana Rohrabacher first.


Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA): Thank you. President Chen, good morning – can you hear me? Well I'm sorry that, I was hoping that you would actually be singing that song for us. So, next time I see you, I'm gonna ask you to sing it for me. I think the real impossible dream is not that the people of Taiwan should have the rights of every other free human being on this planet to determine their own destiny through the ballot box. I think the impossible dream is that the Communist dictatorship not only thinks, in Beijing, not only thinks that they can impose their sovereignty over a group of people who do not want to be part of China, in the Republic of Taiwan, but they think that they can maintain their strong grip of authoritarian power over the people of China. That is the impossible dream. Eventually, not only will the people of Taiwan be free to choose whether they want to be independent or not, but the people of China, eventually, will be free to choose their own government.


And I want to congratulate you and the people of Taiwan for the courage to stand up to this gangster regime on the mainland, to insist on your own rights. Those of us who believe in freedom, and believe that people all over the world have rights that are granted to them by God, which is the essence of what the American Revolution was all about. We are on your side, and we are on the side of the people of Taiwan. They are the ones who will determine who the sovereign entity is that they will owe their allegiance to, not some gangster regime in Beijing, trying to impose its will.


Unfortunately, the Secretary-General of the United Nations seems to have forgot even the rules that govern his behavior. And this is what happens when you deal with gangster regimes and you try to kowtow to these type of monsters that commit the crimes that have been committed by the Beijing regime. [The] Secretary-General does not have the unilateral power to decide that the official position of the United Nations is that Taiwan is part of China. He does not have that authority. And I certainly back your observation, your assertion, that [the] Secretary-General went beyond his scope of authority in making the declaration that he did.


Certainly, the people of Taiwan have a right to apply to the United Nations—especially once the people of Taiwan vote on whether or not that is what they want their official position to be. They have a right to apply to the United Nations and have that application considered as per the rules of the United Nations. So here we have the Communist regime in Beijing undermining even the set rules, the democratic procedures that were established at the United Nations. We can't let that just go by.


I would suggest the history that we have with the United Nations is somewhat nonsensical when it comes to regimes like the one in Beijing. Let's remember, of course, as you did in your remarks, Mr. President, that for many years, the seat in the United Nations that was representing China was being controlled by an authoritarian government that found itself in power in Taipei. And that authoritarian regime under Chiang Kai-shek did not represent the people of China, obviously, and it didn't even represent the people of Taiwan, now, as we are coming to realize because of free elections. So, this idea that the United Nations at that time wasn't recognizing the true government of China, the people who controlled power in China, and in fact, now today they don't want to recognize the true government of Taiwan. So, you have a history in the United Nations of ignoring reality.


The reality is that the people of Taiwan have every right to declare themselves the masters of their own fate through the ballot box, just as every other people in the world have a right to determine their own destiny through the ballot box. We should not be cowering before people who have not even been willing to put themselves before the vote of their own people to, in some way, substantiate their own credibility as a real government, their legitimacy.


Let us note that I have started working with some of my colleagues here to boycott the upcoming Olympics in Beijing. President Chen, I would like to offer you now, publicly, the opportunity to join with us in not sending a team to Beijing as Taiwan and to join us in our boycott of the Olympics. And we are boycotting the Olympics because of the very type of belligerency and threat to stability in the world, but also the repression of their own people, that is represented in Beijing.


One last thought, and that is, there are many people that believe we are gonna create a more peaceful world. And a lot of times the people who are siding with Beijing on this issue on whether the people of Taiwan have a right to determine whether or not they're going to be part of China or not through the ballot box, these people are doing so in a very cowardly way, thinking that this will create more peace and stability in the region and the world. I know and you know, President Chen, that if the people of Taiwan lose and force is used to make them part of, submit to a government that they do not believe in, that this will only be the first step.


Because what China is saying is that it is territory that has rights, and not people. It is the people in Taiwan who have rights. Pieces of land do not have rights. And if we acknowledge, and if we let the regime in Beijing get away with the type of pressure and the use of force, in particular, to obtain its ends—its claims on that territory—what we will see is not a more peaceful world because now that issue has been solved, but instead, Beijing will then move on to its other major territorial claims in the region. Beijing claims huge hunks of territory of what today is Russia; India; it claims huge chunks of the South China Sea. It claims... has many other claims that will lead to nothing but ongoing conflict, if we suggest that land claims are more important than the rights of the people who live on that land to determine their own destiny through the ballot box.


So, we stand with you on principle, and we hope also, for pragmatic reasons, that the people of Taiwan do not give in, that they stand strong, and that yours is not an impossible dream, but instead the dream of all free people in that quest that started in my country 225 years ago, when we declared that all rights are granted by God to every person; and that government only has those powers that are given to it by the consent of the governed. And that is what Taiwan is all about, and that is what the United States is all about. So, good luck, and I'm very pleased to have been with you this morning. We'll be together for a songfest—together real soon. Thank you.


Blumenthal: Thank you very much, Congressman Rohrabacher. As I said, we're going to go through all the comments and questions of the panelists, before President Chen has a chance to respond. So, Dr. Campbell.


Dr. Kurt Campbell, Center for a New American Century: Thanks very much. Thanks, Dan, for helping set this up. I think this shows great initiative, and thank President Chris DeMuth for AEI's continuing support for a strong American engagement in Asia as a whole. And President Chen, I think we were all moved by your passionate appeal, and we thank you for taking the time to address us and to allow us to hear your words.


I also very much liked your rendition of Man of La Mancha [sic]. When I think of Asia policy right now and Taiwan, I actually think of another Broadway musical, in terms of US policy, and that's Cats. Remember that line in Cats, "midnight, not a sound on the pavement," and in fact, what's striking to me right now is that people of goodwill and character can disagree about where we need to head in terms of our Iraq policy in the Middle East. But I think one thing this group—and I know we are joined today by a strong group of people who agree about America's strong interests in Asia, is that we are ignoring many of our interests in Asia, and we are not stepping up to the plate as a great power in Asia over the course of the last several years. We are preoccupied away from Asia, and we've done a bad job. And this is one of the most important issues that the next president of the United States has to readdress. We have to rebalance our portfolio and focus more of our attention on Asia.


As we sit here today, one of the most important dialogues that takes place in Asia is ongoing: APEC—with the American seat empty, because the President had to leave to come back early. I would suggest to you that there's very little the United States has to do to check the box to indicate our strong support for Asia; and there are a few meetings, and unfortunately, over the last couple of years, we haven't been able to find the time to attend those meetings. Secretary Rice has cancelled many of them. President Bush—good for him to spend time with Prime Minister Howard, good on him—but only a short period in APEC, and then we've got to get back. And so the message that we send to Asia is that we've only got one hit on our Rolodex, and that's Iraq. And it's Iraq all the time—and the fact is that we cannot expect to have the influence to shape outcomes in Asia unless we play the Asia game more systematically.


I'm always struck by the words of George Schultz, I think one of our great secretaries of state, when he likened Asia policy to gardening, and that it's a constant—you've got to tend the garden, and we're not tending the garden. And I would say, I think this falls primarily in the lap of the President, but this is a bipartisan preoccupation. Both parties are preoccupied in the Middle East, and we need to address this urgently, or a variety of these issues, I think, will not get the kind of attention that we need.


Second point, if I may. I liked very much President DeMuth's opening comments about the criticism about what we've seen vis-à-vis President Chen's agenda. But his language is carefully crafted. He said it's been criticized by American diplomats, as if somehow American diplomats—that there's this group that is somehow not part of the US government, not part of the Bush administration, and that if only we could get these guys under control… I think we have to step up to the plate, and we can all acknowledge here, this is being criticized by the Bush administration, right? The Bush administration! And so I think actually one of the most important things that can occur right now is to rebalance the domestic, sort of, power issues within the US government. I would like to see Congress play a little bit more active a role on these issues. They've not—they've been absent, sorry Congressman, generally—


Rohrabacher (interjects): I'm right here! Haha.


Campbell:—over the last six or seven years, absent as an institution. And now, really, it's on the Democrats: to hold more hearings, to call the administration to task, to ask them to explain, "What are your goals and ambitions vis-à-vis the Asia-Pacific, and also what do you want to accomplish vis-à-vis the cross-straits?"


Third and final point, and then I have a question quickly, Dan. The third and final point is that if you sum up, and basically characterize what is the nature of the message that we have sent Taiwan over the last, basically since 2001—and let's remember that although we have not said it enough publicly: Thank you President Chen, for the support that Taiwan has given us in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in a variety of places. Now, we just have not said that enough. But the truth is that Taiwan was one of the first countries to come up to the plate and said, "We want to assist you. We want to assist you." We did not ask. They volunteered. That's an important point and it's something we should be grateful of.


Our essential policy point to Taiwan is this: We support your freedom, we will help in assisting and protecting you, but we're incredibly busy. We've got a lot of stuff going on in the world and we don't want you to make a fuss. And you've got to basically not create problems for us elsewhere. Now I think that those talking points could be fairly and effectively deployed for about a year after 2001. But the fact is that that is the essential, distilled version of the message that we give Taiwan on a consistent basis. I think it's no longer applicable; and unfortunately, I think we're heading into one of those periods that we're going to need a much more significant review of the foundations of our policy, the United States towards Taiwan.


I think that it makes sense, it's in American interests, to increase our dialogue and our communication with Taiwan for no other reason than to prevent misunderstandings or difficulties. I'm struck by how convoluted of late the policy communication is between Taipei and Washington. I'd like us to focus more on a more positive set of agenda items. It strikes me that it seems rather negative at this context, and I'd like to see a little bit more positive. And so this comes at a difficult time, in which candidates are going to be saying things—probably raising unrealistic expectations. But the fact remains that we're going to need a much more systematic look, hopefully a bipartisan look, at how to manage the Taiwan Straits, and also how to support a friend in Taiwan.


Last point: I would just like to ask the President a question. President Chen—and again, we appreciate your opportunity to spend time with us—have any countries in the Asia-Pacific region communicated to you privately, or given you any support, or suggested that they too are concerned by this turn of events? Because I was also moved by some of the points that Congressman Rohrabacher made about Secretary General Ban Ki-moon exceeding some of what, some view, are the prerogatives of his responsibility.


Again, thank you, and thanks to Dan for the opportunity to be here.


Blumenthal: Thank you very much, and again, President Chen is gracious enough to wait to answer all the question bundled together. So, Dr. Green.


Dr. Michael Green, Center for Strategic and International Studies: Thank you Dan, and thank you Chris. I also want to join Kurt in applauding AEI for organizing this. There are well-known policy restrictions on our high-level engagement with Taiwan, and often using technology in this way allows us to have the kind of substantive dialogue we need, as you know, Mr. President, from some of your phone calls with senior officials like J. D. Crouch of the NSC [US National Security Council] or the Deputy Secretaries of State and Defense. And I think AEI has been creative, and really helped our friendship and our policy dialogue with this forum.


I also thought of a musical, and I imagine everybody's going to have their favorite musical. For me, it was Fiddler on the Roof, and the scene when the old couple is alone and the husband turns to the wife and says, "Do you love me?" And then she says, "Do I love you? For 25 years I've mended your socks, I've cooked your food." And the reality is, as Kurt has suggested, we have some difficulties now between Taipei and Washington, but the record between our two peoples and our governments is very strong, and Kurt is right to thank you and to thank Taiwan and the people of Taiwan, for helping in places as far away from Taiwan as Afghanistan, as Iraq. And I know that you appreciate that President Bush or Secretary Rice or others have stood very firm in meetings with Chinese leaders—I can tell you, I was there—have stood very firm in standing by our commitments to Taiwan, and in ensuring that Beijing does not unilaterally change the status quo. Some very tough encounters behind closed doors with Chinese leaders on these issues. And that's because we have, in the United States, a very real strategic interest in the success of Taiwan as a democracy.


The US and Japan, in 2005, said that our two countries have a shared strategic objective of stability in the Taiwan Strait. It's more than just geography, it's more than just stability—we have a shared stake in the success of Taiwan's democracy, because this is something that is watched around the region, and watched, frankly, by 1.3 billion people in China, who see the rule of law and democratic experience working in Taiwan.


As Kurt said, we have had an increasingly negative tone to our bilateral dialogue, and I think we need to think harder about a positive agenda, and there are items that I would put forward, I'd appreciate your reaction when you speak to us at the end of our panel. It seems to me that a free trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan is in the interests of both countries. We have an interest in having a gold standard FTA with a free market economy in the center of Northeast Asia; our businesses have an interest in a bastion based on the rule of law where they can engage the region, including China. And of course, Taiwan has an interest in locking itself into this broader Asian trade architecture.


I agree with Kurt. I think we need to find ways to elevate our official dialogue. There have been efforts in the Congress to force the administration to allow flag rank officers to travel to Taiwan. From my perspective, those are largely symbolic. What's really important is allowing policy officials to have more direct, free, and open discussion for all of the reasons that Kurt discussed. I think we can do a lot more together on democracy promotion. Taiwan and the US both spend a lot of money in foreign aid and we can help governments improve their governance, improve their democratic institutions if we coordinate more.


But I think to move to this positive agenda we each have to do our homework. It will be difficult to do some of these things in the current environment. But I think they are realistic, possible, and in our interests if we make efforts on each side. I think for the US side, we need to recognize that the issue of identity in Taiwan is not a political game. It is not a tactical move in Taipei. It is a very fundamental issue—not at all unique to the 23 million people on Taiwan. If you look at Korea, if you look at Japan, national identity is at the top of the agenda for every country in Asia and there's no reason why Taiwan should be any different. And I think that the US, both government and scholars, need to appreciate that. Not always look at this as an issue of tactics or politics, recognize that it is fundamental to the future of Taiwan; and the US has an interest in this and a stake, and it should be concerned and interested in it. On the Taiwan side, I think there is homework as well. I think there needs to be more thought given to what agenda for Taiwan will strengthen support for Taiwan's democracy, strengthen support for Taiwan's security. I think Taiwan has very good friends. We're here in Washington but I think in Japan you have good friends. You have friends elsewhere in Asia and in Europe. It seems to me that any agenda for Taiwan should be designed to strengthen these partnerships among democratic nations and societies and pull us closer together. It reinforces the example of Taiwan's democracy for the people on the mainland and it enhances Taiwan's security and it seems to me that we need to think carefully about whether specific agenda items like applying to the UN under the name "Taiwan." And that's a complex issue and there are nuances to it. And I can see many of the merits of what you are saying, but I think it is important that we, in the interests not only of stability but of the success of Taiwan's democracy and identity, think about the best way to advance that: ways that will bond the people of Taiwan with their natural friends and allies in countries like the US and Japan. But that's going to require high level discussion—panels like this. I very much appreciate your presentation, Mr. President. As Kurt said, you have been a very good friend to the United States. I think you've raised some very important points that people in this town sometimes forget about the nature of the Chinese military threat, about the intentions demonstrated in the Anti-Secession Law, the failings at the UN, and the consequences of what the Secretary-General has done and these are all things that we will take to heart and endeavor to help you and the people of Taiwan correct. But thank you very much and I look forward to your response to our questions and I also look forward to hearing you sing Man of La Mancha or whatever Broadway musical seems appropriate. Thank you.


Blumenthal: Thank you very much, Dr. Green. This would be good time for me to shamelessly plug a report of the kind that Mike Green and Kurt Campbell are talking about, that AEI is working on with Armitage International—that will be bipartisan and looking at a positive agenda with Taiwan—that should come out in the beginning of next year. And President Chen has been very cooperative with that as well. Let us turn to Dr. Wang, who actually has written quite a bit about Taiwan and the UN and international organizations, and we look forward to his comments.


Dr. Vincent Wei-cheng Wang, Associate Professor, University of Richmond: Thank you. I want to thank the AEI for this opportunity and applaud AEI for organizing this video conferencing. Good evening, Mr. President. Dan Zongtong, li ho [hello in Taiwanese]. I was born and raised in Kaohsiung, so it is very like homecoming for me, even though I can only see you virtually. I agree with Doctors Campbell and Green that there should be more need for more substantive, more positive dialogue between the US and Taiwan. I also agree with Dr. Green that understanding Taiwan's domestic politics will help the United States appreciate Taiwan's democracy a little bit more, improving bilateral relationship. But I want to share with you a few of my thoughts about Taiwan's international participation. About 13 years ago, I wrote an article about the issue of Taiwan's entry into the United Nations and in that article I highlighted six different models. Taiwan could enter the UN either as "exclusive representation," in other words repeal Resolution 2758. The second model would be the "new state" model. The third model would be "parallel representation" like what the Koreas and the Germanys used to be. The fourth model is the "ADB [Asian Development Bank], APEC" model, essentially a "one China, one Taiwan" model. The fifth model is a "Soviet Union" model, namely one country but several seats. And finally is the "Vietnam" model, namely one seat for one unified country. The Taiwanese government since 1993 until this year seemed to have adopted an agnostic approach. [It] was mum about what approach to take. Starting from this year it seems that you are pushing for a "new state" model.


I have written another article, about two years ago, trying to develop a new model for Taiwan's international participation. It is based on some basic ideas. One is that in this era of globalization, functional competency has replaced the importance of sovereignty, and also Taiwan, due to its functional importance, can actually play a very important role in the international community. So I actually mentioned four points [with] this model. I was wondering if you could care to comment. The first point is to decouple, to separate the issue of Taiwan's international governmental organization participation and diplomatic recognition. In other words, we take Taiwan's international participation at its face value but at the same time we don't challenge the PRC's [People's Republic of China] position on Taiwan. So we try to find a way for Taiwan to have meaningful representation in IO's [international organizations]. Second point actually is to amend those charters and constitutions of international government organizations that allegedly only admit sovereign states so that they can also admit a functionally competent entity in a particular area, for example, fishing, or finance, or humanitarian assistance, and so on. So, all they have to do is to add one sentence that membership is open to sovereign states and a functional competent entity in a particular area. The third point is that to state on Taiwan's entry document that admission into a given IGO—intergovernmental organization—does not have any impact on that body's position on the issue of China representation or imply sovereignty for Taiwan. However, this condition does not prevent other members from recognizing Taiwan, either. And finally, stipulating in the documents that Taiwan will automatically lose membership if it declares independence after its entry into the intergovernmental organizations. Because this is again to make good on Taiwan's promise or aspiration to have meaningful representation in international organizations but at the same time to basically sidestep the issue of sovereignty.


I want to leave with two questions. One is that the US has been very supportive of Taiwan. Maybe some people in Taiwan feel that it could do more, but in terms of international participation, we know that, in the past, US support has been crucial in the case of APEC, in the case of WTO. It seems that without the US support—and of course, the PRC was not a member in either organization when Taiwan joined. So these two conditions, [first] Taiwan and PRC join at the same time or the PRC does not precede Taiwan, and [second] the US support[s Taiwan's participation] seemed to be a pattern and I wonder if the same pattern will hold for future participation. My question is: What concrete steps do you have in order to repair the US-Taiwan relations—as Doctors Campbell and Green mentioned, the positive agenda—and what expectations do you have for the next US administration either Republican or Democratic. Thank you very much, and good evening.


Blumenthal: Thank you very much for those comments and questions. Dr. Gary Schmitt.


Dr. Gary Schmitt, AEI: Mr. President, thank you for joining us and good evening. When you began to talk about or began to mention the Man of La Mancha and the song, I guess I began to show my age a bit and thought of another song which was, the words were, "You don't always get what you want. But if you try sometime, you get what you need." For those of you who are younger than me, that comes from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones. I actually prefer that song too, because the Man of La Mancha, actually, the bottom line is that he never gets what he wants. Let me begin by just stepping back a little bit, and I have been struck by, as Chris DeMuth mentioned, the rolling crisis that we seem to be in. But I think that the perversity of the current situation is really quite striking. We have a situation in which obviously there is a great deal of tension in the US over Taiwan's decision to go forward on a referendum, tension in the Taiwan Strait, and obviously a lot of discussion going back and forth between Taipei, Beijing, and Washington.


Nevertheless, I am struck by the degree by which all the focus is on what Taiwan is doing, and, in fact, if you stepped back and thought about it for half a second, in fact, you would say that Taiwan is behaving as you would expect a normal democratic state to behave and is doing precisely what you would want a so-called responsible stakeholder to do.


In contrast, the state, the country, that we hardly or the country that we constantly refer to as trying to become a responsible stakeholder is behaving in just the opposite way. It continues to threaten Taiwan with military force, its rhetoric is nothing but non-peaceful, and on top of which it behaves toward Taiwan as though in an irredentist, 19th century manner. You know, if tomorrow we found out that Berlin was looking, or cabled the government in Paris, and said, "You know, we'd really like to revisit Alsace, we really think it belongs to us again," we wouldn't tolerate that for half a second. But somehow, we've come to accept China's claim toward Taiwan as though that's a normal thing. And I think, again, stepping back for half a second, we realize just how perverse this situation has become.


Now, on the particulars, I just want to say that nothing actually precludes the US from accepting Taiwan's effort. The nine-point document that the State Department developed, sent to the UN in response to the Secretary-General's recent comments, the very first point is quote, "We take no position on the status of Taiwan. We neither accept nor reject the claim that Taiwan is a part of China." In short, the United States is agnostic and there is no particular reason why UN membership infringes upon that agnosticism.


The second thing is that in fact, from US policy point of view, [i.e. the] one-China policy, UN membership for Taiwan doesn't foreclose future questions about Taiwan's ultimate status. So again, there's nothing in US policy per se, that precludes or should foreclose Taiwan trying to get into the UN. And in fact, as our good professor remarked, the US in the past has accepted states into the UN that it didn't recognize at the time. After all, North Korea is in the UN right now, but we don't recognize North Korea diplomatically. East Germany joined the UN a full year before we gave it diplomatic recognition.


Next, there is nothing in the UN resolution that forecloses Taiwan's membership in the UN. Twenty-seven fifty-eight, as the president pointed out, does not mention Taiwan or its status. And finally, this question of use of the name "Taiwan" shouldn't also foreclose, or be such a problem. There are plenty of states in the UN right now that use names that aren't their official names. That includes China, Greece, and Macedonia. So the use of the term Taiwan should not be seen as an aggressive move on the part of the Republic of China.


Now, to wrap up, I think one key reason that to begin to step back a moment and take a look at the situation, the key reason for our current predicament is that, as Kurt and others have pointed out, the US, this administration, has done an extremely poor job of trying to provide Taiwan with international space. We have given it very much half-hearted support for membership in the WHO; we have done nothing to move forward on an FTA. And, in fact, when the Secretary-General made his remarks recently that Taiwan was a part of China, the US State Department response was quite tepid. We still have not forced the Secretary-General to change his remarks or correct his remarks.


In short, while Taiwan is often accused of trying to change the status quo with this referendum, the reality is that the status quo is being moved on it. It is being moved by China and it is being moved by a passive United States response to the pressure that the Chinese have put forward. So I'll end there.


Blumenthal: Well, thank all of you very much. President Chen, you made everyone disclose their favorite musicals. I think Mike Green is spot on with Fiddler on the Roof, but the right song probably describing our policy is "Tradition," not the other one and unfortunately, it's tradition that may have to be updated in the next administration. But anyway, thank you for graciously listening to our comments and to our questions. And I'd like to turn it back over to you to respond any way you wish. Thank you, Mr. President.


President Chen’s comments:


(Having listened to the comments of the participants, the President responded as follows):


President Chen Shui-bian: I would like to thank each of the participants for your report and many valuable opinions. First, Congressman Rohrabacher said that he and his colleagues plan to boycott the 2008 Beijing Olympics, that Taiwan has the right to UN participation, and that the Chiang Kai-shek regime did not represent the people of China or Taiwan. In response to your comment about boycotting the Olympics and hoping that Taiwan will not send a delegation to Beijing, I must stress that our primary concern is the issue of participation in the Olympic Games. In particular, when Taiwan's delegation participates in the Beijing Olympics, we do not want to see Taiwan's status downgraded. Additionally, the passing of the Olympic Torch through Taiwan is a sports event that should not be politicized or used as part of Beijing's united front tactics. We have worked hard with great sincerity to smooth out this issue. Our Olympic Committee has been frank and forthright in its communication with the Beijing Olympic Committee. We hope that this issue will be resolved. We welcome the Olympic Torch to pass through Taiwan, on the condition that Taiwan's status absolutely must not be downgraded. This is exceedingly important. We thank Congressman Rohrabacher for your encouragement and support that Taiwan should remain firm and steadfast, for what we pursue is not an impossible dream. We too believe that as long as we do the right things and go down the right path, we will one day succeed.


We would also like to thank Dr. Campbell for raising an important issue. You mentioned that the United States should not only focus on the Middle East and neglect Asia. Moreover, the focus on Asian issues should not be limited to the Korean Peninsula, as the issue of the Taiwan Strait deserves equal consideration. Furthermore, the Taiwan issue not only concerns China on the other side of the Taiwan Strait. As the 23 million people of Taiwan are also part of the democratic community to which President Bush attaches great importance, they hope to be treated equally. Dr. Campbell also mentioned how crucial balance is, and that America's focus of attention should be balanced. If, for instance, the administrative branch tilts toward China, the American Congress should step up to the plate, play its proper role, and fulfill its duties. I think Dr. Campbell's suggestions are very valuable and that all parties involved would do well to note them.


For a long time, it seems that Taiwan has been seen as cooperative and obedient by the United States. But just because Taiwan has been America's most loyal ally, and has long stood with the American government and people on a host of issues, doesn't mean the United States should take this for granted and ignore Taiwan's needs. We have been neglected in many areas. Is this because Taiwan has been too obedient and too cooperative for the past decade? Our being ignored has forced us to reflect on the past and ask what went wrong.


I also want to thank Dr. Green for speaking to substantive dialogue. Taiwan and the US are faithful friends to one another. The two sides should engage in substantive dialogue. We very much appreciate Dr. Green's contributions as Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and Senior Director for Asian Affairs at the National Security Council. During his time in these positions, relations between Taiwan and the US were very cordial and close. That was mainly because we had very good channels of communication and substantive high-level dialogues. We lack these now. Who is responsible for this?


We have time and again called on the US to strengthen dialogue between the top officials of our two countries. The best channel for communication is not the US State Department or via the Director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan. The reason why many issues have turned into problems might lie in this. Due to a lack of substantive dialogue between top officials and channels of communication, many unnecessary differing opinions and misunderstandings have come into being. For instance, our friends in the US executive branch believe that the issues of Taiwan's participation in the UN and the UN referendum are of my own making. They ask me to use my influence, and believe that if only I oppose it, the idea of a UN referendum will go away. They have consistently put pressure on me. As the US supports Taiwan's democratization, it should also respect the diversity of voices that exist in our democratic society. Some people think that we should enter the UN under the name "Taiwan," because we should not deceive ourselves as well as others, or repeat the mistakes of the past. In the past, no matter whether we tried to return to the UN using the name "Republic of China" or enter the UN using the name "Republic of China (Taiwan)", we failed, which shows that these approaches were wrong. We hope to adjust our strategy concerning entering the UN. We also hope to communicate with the US on this matter. It is wrong to think that this is solely my idea. It is the shared wish of a vast majority of the 23 million people on Taiwan. Being the president of a democratic country, I cannot oppose, nor can I ignore, the will of the people. I believe that President Bush understands fully that democratic countries deeply respect the will of the people. The UN Secretary-General's comment that Taiwan is a part of China simply does not accord with the facts and is not in line with UN Resolution 2758. Since UN Resolution 2758 does not even mention Taiwan, how can it be interpreted in such a way that Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of China? I would like to express my gratitude to the United States for having taken notice of this. This also is inconsistent with the US's "one China" policy. This is something we would like to express heartfelt gratitude for.


Since the US considers maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan Strait as being in its own interest, as well as that of Taiwan's 23 million people, it is important for the governments of Taiwan and the US to sit down and discuss this. Were we to accept that Taiwan is a province or part of China, then we could just relinquish our sovereignty over Taiwan and surrender to China. As a consequence, we would worry about neither military procurement from the US nor diplomatic suppression from China. Obviously the US government would not allow that to happen. Therefore, since maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan Strait is in the interests of both Taiwan and the US, how is it wrong that we do not accept that Taiwan is a part of the People's Republic of China? Why has the US government chosen to sour relations between our peoples, instead of simply communicating with us?


Furthermore, I would like to thank Dr. Wang for your comments. We all understand that, without the US government's support, Taiwan would not have been able to become the 144th member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) just after China's entry. It is an incontrovertible fact that we would not have been admitted to the WTO without US support. Likewise for APEC. This year, I still have to send a special envoy as my representative to the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting to be held in Sydney over the next few days. It's not fair to us, yet we have no choice but to accept and endure this unfair treatment, and yet we are still grateful to the US government for having supported Taiwan's admission to APEC.


In terms of our WHO bid, it is very clear that the US government supports Taiwan to become an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA), albeit as a "health entity." We are willing to compromise to apply for WHA observership in this way. But eleven years have gone by, and we still have not succeeded. In 2005, the US government expressed its support for Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in the WHO. But in July of the same year, China and the WHO Secretariat secretly signed a memorandum of understanding to demote Taiwan's status to that of a local government of China.


We feel that "meaningful participation" has turned into "meaningless participation." The US government has shown great concern over our participation and has desired to help Taiwan. But of our 11 years of trying, including my seven years in office, there has been nothing but painful failure. If you were Taiwan's president, if you were Taiwan's government, if you were Taiwan's people, would you continue to tolerate this? Wouldn't you want to say something? Indeed, we have already waited too long. Should we continue to wait?


Of course, we are in hopes that the newly elected US president next year, no matter Republican or Democrat, will continue to support Taiwan. And I also have one hope that, no matter which party takes power, it will not hold back its support for Taiwan. I remember that former President George H.W. Bush only decided to sell Taiwan F-16 fighter jets during the last year of his term. Though these were F-16 A/Bs, we were very pleased. As enhancing Taiwan's national defense was considered to be of great importance and the sale of fighter jets was to be made, why did the president wait until his last year in office to approve a sale that had been long before requested by Taiwan?


We hope such a scenario will not occur under the current President Bush. We have finally gained the support of our Legislature for a defense budget to purchase F-16 C/Ds. This was not an easy task. But this budget was approved and the Legislature required us to get the Letter of Offer and Acceptance from the United States by the end of October. However, the information we have received indicates that President Bush has decided to approve the sale of F-16 C/Ds only after May 20 of next year, after Taiwan's new president has taken office. If enhancing Taiwan's national defense and consolidating its defense capabilities are considered to be of such importance, why can't the sale be approved now if it can be approved next year? So whichever party takes power next year, we look for the new administration not to have any reservations in its support for Taiwan. I hope that the things I have just touched upon will provoke discussion.


Of course, we greatly appreciate Dr. Schmitt's suggestions and opinions, in which you indicated particularly that using a country's national moniker is not a requirement when applying for UN membership. We have found that around 40 percent of the more than 190 members of the United Nations are not using their national moniker as their name when participating in the organization. Therefore, the issue that my country would like to enter the United Nations using the name "Taiwan" definitely does not involve a change in our national moniker. As such, I am not breaking my oft-repeated "four noes" pledge to President Bush, the US government, or the international community. Neither previous pledges nor the status quo are being affected here.


Dr. Schmitt also pointed out the responses the US State Department made concerning the remarks of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with regard to our bid to join the UN. In fact, the US government was right in responding as it did to this. However, we do not wish to see it behave in such a secretive manner. When it has differences with Taiwan, the US expresses its criticisms and opposition openly. But when it comes to differences of opinion with China, it tends to express its reservations under the table, out of the public eye. This contrast is very apparent to the 23 million people of Taiwan, and we regret it deeply. We want to be treated fairly.


Mr. Harvey Feldman, one of the architects of the Taiwan Relations Act, visited Taiwan recently. He intimated that according to the Act, Taiwan is a country. With the exceptions of appointing an ambassador and establishing an embassy, the United States recognizes that Taiwan is a country separate from China. Besides this, he indicated that according to the Act, Taiwan is allowed to participate in international organizations, including the WHO and UN. This is what Harvey Feldman told me yesterday at our meeting. We are very thankful for this. As Confucius said, "The virtuous will not be alone." Thank you very much.


Blumenthal: Thank you very much, Mr. President. We will now have time for just a few questions. And I'd like to, with the President's permission, take three questions all at once, and have the President respond at one time as well. Questions?


Q&A:
 
Marina Malenic, Inside Defense: Hello. My name is Marina Malenic with Inside Defense. And I'd like to ask you, President Chen, you mentioned F-16 sales. Can you please also comment on PAC-3 sales and why it's important for your country to acquire that system, also where that situation stands?


Foster Klug, Associated Press: Mr. President, Foster Klug with the Associated Press. I was hoping to figure out if, in your estimation, this UN referendum is going to be worth it, considering the anger that it's creating in the US and in China, and considering that it's largely a symbolic effort on Taiwan's part, with a very little chance of actually going through the UN. Thanks.


Gregory Ho, Radio Free Asia: Gregory Ho from Radio Free Asia. Mr. Chen, I just wonder, what do you comment on the Chinese President Hu Jintao's recent remarks on the role of the Chinese PLA and enforcing the role of unifying Taiwan? What is your response to the Chinese president's comment on Taiwan? Thank you.


Blumenthal: [And now] over to you, Mr. President for your responses.


President Chen responses: 


President Chen: Strengthening our national defense and enhancing our self-defense capabilities are both our duty and responsibility. For many years, we have not backed down from our commitment. The 2007 defense budget was increased to 2.85 percent of GDP, and we hope to increase it to 3 percent for 2008. In the defense budget for 2008 currently being drafted for submission to the Legislative Yuan, we are looking at an increase of NT$40 billion such that we may reach our goal of 3 percent of GDP. This demonstrates our will and determination. 


We are very grateful for President Bush's having approved at one time the sale of three major weapons systems to Taiwan. It is to be regretted that the budget for purchasing these systems stalled in the Legislative Yuan for several years. But through a concerted effort, we finally broke the deadlock in June and July of this year, when part of the budget to fund upgrades to the PAC-2 Patriot missiles and purchase P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft was passed. These are essential for strengthening Taiwan's national defense.


Similarly, the main reason for purchasing F-16 C/D jet fighters is that the F-5 series fighters we currently have need to be replaced. We hope to replace them with F-16 C/D jet fighters. With so many points of view represented in the Legislative Yuan, gaining support is no easy task. We hope that the US government will recognize and respond positively to our efforts, so that our hard-won defense budget will not have to be returned to the treasury at the end of October.


Moreover, the main reason for holding a referendum on applying for UN membership is that we know the consensual view is for differences and disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to be resolved peacefully through dialogue. This includes issues such as the status quo in the Taiwan Strait will not be changed unilaterally. The most obvious and peaceful means, of course, is to engage in dialogue and consultation. We cannot rely solely on weapons. Values, our democratic values, are far more important. We must avoid a unilateral or militarily induced change to the status quo. We must avoid there being put forward a proposal in the UN to change the status quo unilaterally or to make Taiwan part of the People's Republic of China, as these go beyond the scope of UN Resolution 2758. Given moves in these directions, Taiwan's 23 million people must speak out and express our views to the outside world. We will use neither force nor military power. We will use instead love and democratic ballots, that is, a referendum.


The 23 million people of Taiwan should have the right to express their opinion with regard to Taiwan's future, Taiwan destiny, and especially cross-strait relations. They should even enjoy the right to say "no" to China. This is what referenda are for. They are legitimate and necessary. A patient explanation is required to show that referenda have more than symbolic value, that we believe referenda to have a substantive function and convey substantive meaning.


Even more importantly, regarding our internal situation, we all understand that for a nation to be safe today, its people must be united. The single issue of arms procurement from the US has aroused such a divergence of opinion: Should we purchase US arms? How many? Do we agree to pay for this? How much shall we pay? People have different opinions. Why? Because many people are doubtful: Is Taiwan a country? Should we have our own self-defense capabilities or would it be better for us to become part of China? That way, we wouldn't need diplomatic relations, we wouldn't need a defense capability, and therefore, we wouldn't need to purchase any weapons at all.


With regard to the issue of UN membership, we have finally arrived at a consensus [domestically], which is to participate in the international community and to become as a member of international organizations such as the UN. The US government, the people of the United States, and the US Congress should give all the more greater encouragement and support to Taiwan in this respect, as it is the best and most democratic way to prevent a unilateral change to the status quo. Not the sound of guns, not the use of force, but rather a democratic vote for self-defense.


We have learned of Mr. Hu Jintao's recent remarks, including those made during talks with President Bush during his trip to Australia. But, we must tell the whole world that Taiwan is definitely not a part of the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is Taiwan. China is China. Taiwan is a sovereign state. It sovereignty belongs to the 23 million people of Taiwan. Taiwan is not a second Hong Kong. Taiwan of course cannot be referred to as "China Taipei." This is not just me speaking, but the 23 million people of Taiwan.


So how can this be demonstrated concretely? If you don't believe what I say and think it is merely my own opinion, then let us have a referendum and have the world hear the voice of the people. Perhaps there will end up being a 60 or 70 percent majority opinion that comes of it, letting the whole world know about us as a country. Our territory is limited to Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. It does not include mainland China or Mongolia. This is a historical fact and is the status quo.


President Hu Jintao was obliged to say what he has said, but for the 23 million people of Taiwan, it is completely unacceptable. Thank you.


Blumenthal: Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you very much to all of our panelists. Thank you very much to the audience for participating today as well. I'd also like to give a special thanks to the TECRO staff led by Joseph Wu, and our own staff led by Laura Coniff for putting together this very difficult technical experiment. And I think it went very well. Thank you very much, President Chen, for your time. You were very generous with us, and good luck to you.

Should discrepancies exist between the Chinese and English transcripts of the President's remarks, the Chinese version takes priority.
