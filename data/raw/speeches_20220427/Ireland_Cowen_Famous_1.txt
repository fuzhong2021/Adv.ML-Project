•Fianna Fáil to focus on all elements of jobs policy - Government Chief WhipSpeech by An Taoiseach, Mr Brian Cowen, TD, Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party Conference, Galway, Monday 13th September 2010.
It is a pleasure to be with you here today in Galway, a place of such great culture, tradition and natural beauty.
The period ahead is crucial for Ireland. How we respond to the challenges of framing the upcoming budget, restoring confidence in our banking system and getting people back to work will shape Ireland’s future in the period ahead. Our duty in government is to discharge these responsibilities with determination and commitment.
As in the past, when this country has faced major challenges, the Fianna Fáil Party has always worked together with common purpose to meet and master them.
Commitment and courage are needed now, more than ever, as we continue to take decisions that will guide Ireland to prosperity once more.
This is one of those times in the life of the nation when we have to take a long term view and implement the necessary measures to restore the fortunes of our people and our country.
Ireland is still a successful country with huge potential for the future.
There is more to this country than Anglo-Irish Bank - terrible burden though that is.We still have far more people at work than we did ten years ago.Our people are highly-skilled and very well-educated by international standards.We still have many of the most successful modern companies in the world operating here.In the last two weeks alone, we have seen the opening of a new railway line (Dunboyne), two major motorway projects (M50 upgrade and Dublin-Waterford) and a state-of-the-art national convention centre. Later this year, we will see the opening of a new world-class terminal at Dublin Airport.These all add to our economic potential and they are clear signals of our optimism and confidence as a country.That is the spirit we need.
As a nation, we have to believe in ourselves if we want other people to believe in us, to invest with us and to trade with us.We must use the talents and the imagination of our people to create opportunities, not just bemoan our problems, but fix them and move on.That is the only way we can generate economic recovery and jobs for our people.This country needs to maintain its international reputation.I know from my direct experience that our reputation is much higher abroad than many of us think.People around the world know we have problems but they also admire what we have achieved as a country and how we are setting about solving the problems we have.In difficult times, the government borrows abroad to fund spending on essential public services such as hospitals and schools, as well on social protection for pensioners and the unemployed.At the same time, the banks need to access funds on international markets so they can extend credit to our businesses to help them prosper and to protect and create jobs.That is why we have to show the outside world that we can fix our problems and that we can pay our debts.That is why we are acting decisively to reform our banking system, to recapitalise our banks and to reduce our budget deficit.It is not about bail-outs - it is about jobs for our people, funding for our public services and recovery for our economy.Jobs are the over-riding priority of the government and economic growth is the key to our recovery.We are absolutely focused on- helping the unemployed- driving our exports- increasing our competitiveness and productivity, and- reducing our costs.
All of the international evidence tells us that we need to keep people who lose their jobs close to the labour market, through offering training opportunities and new skills.Already, we have more than doubled the number of state training places and our higher education system has taken on significant extra numbers of students.We will place an even greater emphasis on these labour market activation measures over the coming months, as the restructuring of FAS and government departments which I put in place after the cabinet reshuffle begins to pay dividends.We are focusing on growing our exports, which have remained strong despite the crisis.We want to help Irish companies to be as successful in export markets as the multinational companies who are based here.We have conducted an in-depth analysis of our potential export markets around the world – not just Europe and the US, but also Brazil, India, Russia, China and across Asia, Africa and other emerging economies. Before the end of this month, we will publish and implement a new trade, tourism and investment strategy for Ireland.We are focusing on competitiveness and productivity.We have already decided to spend a further 40 billion euros on further upgrading our infrastructure, building on the completion of the national motorway network.We have also launched the largest ever investment in the research capacity of our universities and institutes of technology, as well as establishing the new €500m Innovation Fund.We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of our higher education system, which is fundamental to our future success as a society, not just as an economy. A new national strategy for higher education will be considered by the Government in the period ahead.Ireland’s future success depends on a relentless focus on developing our fundamental strengths while also responding to significant challenges.The opposition are past masters at highlighting problems, some of which are real and others not, but they have no coherent solutions and refuse to recognise the exceptional potential of the Irish economy. In periods of difficulty, it is all too easy to undermine Ireland’s strengths and as our future depends on recognising and developing these strengths, this is a major mistake on their part.
Therefore, I do want to focus today on six of Ireland’s fundamental strengths and our plans to develop these. In particular, I will refer to:1) Ireland’s especially high-share of multinational investment;2) Our success as a nation in developing one of the best locations in the world for doing business;3) Our exceptionally strong education sector;4) The rapid growth in educational attainment;5) The development of high-quality scientific and research institutions;6) Our transformed national infrastructure.These strengths are real, not imagined. They have come about by choice, not by chance.As a nation, we have allocated significant public expenditure and effort to develop these strengths and they will provide the platform for our future prosperity.1. Ireland’s high-share of multinational investmentIreland’s strong share of multinational investment is the envy of many countries and we are aiming to attract more than 640 additional projects by 2016. Last year alone, we attracted 125 new investment projects despite it being one of the most difficult years ever for the Irish economy.As a result of the focus and work of this Government, the stock of US Direct Investment in Ireland reached $165 billion in 2009. This compares to $9.3 billion in Poland or $2 billion in Greece. US foreign investment in Ireland is therefore 81 times the level of US investment in Greece.This is an indication of how connected we are with the rest of the world in exporting goods and services by way of the most influential business corporations on the globe, providing jobs and export earnings that are critical for Ireland’s recovery.It is the Government’s intention to ensure that this sector, as well as our indigenous manufacturing base, is given priority and this was strongly reflected in our recent Capital Investment Programme.Our largest sector in Irish industry is food and drinks which exports 85% of its output to 160 locations worldwide. The Government is setting an objective of increasing indigenous exports by 33% to be achieved by 2015 and to diversify the destination of those exports.Developing and internationalising our own indigenous export base will be a crucial factor in our recovery.The total value of exports from Irish owned companies who are assisted by Enterprise Ireland reached €13.4 billion in 2008. Looking at exports generally, even in 2008 and 2009, during the global downturn, Ireland’s exports showed a remarkable resilience. The total value of all our exports both manufacturing and services came to €150 billion and the fall in exports was considerably less dramatic than elsewhere. Exports this year are well ahead of 2008 and 2009.2. Ireland as one of the best locations in the world for doing businessEnhancing Ireland’s success in developing one of the best locations in the world for doing business is a key issue for Government.World Bank rankings rate Ireland as the 7th best location in the world for doing business and we intend to work to enable Ireland to become the Number One best location of any nation for doing business.Businesses, whether Irish or foreign, who create significant employment in Ireland will be facilitated in every way possible by the Government.3. Strong education sectorOur exceptionally strong education sector is something which we as a nation can be proud of and the skills and commitment of our teachers and professors is a real advantage for Ireland.This has been supported by very high levels of investment and we will continue to invest in education in good and bad years as well as continually adapting our education system to fit new needs.The 2010 Global Competitiveness Report - just published - rates Ireland as having the 4th best quality of higher education among the 27 EU nations, with higher ratings than the UK, Germany and France.4. Growth in educational attainmentIreland has also secured a very rapid increase in educational attainment. We have as a result of on-going support achieved one of the highest rates of growth in educational attainment in the world.While we are all aware of this, its significance must be recognised and guaranteed. We know that many of us have had more education opportunities than our parents and we will ensure this race to the top will continue.At 32%, Ireland is now one of the world leaders in the percentage of working age population who have third level education. This compares to 13% in Italy, 23% in Germany and 26% in France.The Fianna Fáil Party in government will continue to give our people increased access to third and fourth level education to support the requirements of the Smart Economy and to fulfil the potential of our people.5. High-quality scientific and research institutionsSince we established Science Foundation Ireland, there has been a transformation in the contribution made by science and research to the economic life of the country.I am pleased to see that the Global Competition Report has now ranked the quality of Irish Scientific and Research Institutes in the top quarter worldwide. We will continue to bring forward new initiatives to support this area and will be working with Science Foundation Ireland to improve our leadership in this field.6. National InfrastructureAs I mentioned earlier, the transformation of our infrastructure is evident throughout our country and is of significant benefit to our work in promoting Ireland as being “open for business.”Ireland’s massive investment in our road network has improved competitiveness by cutting journey times, for example, from Cork to Dublin by nearly 1 hour and Dublin to Galway by 40 minutes, as well as achieving major time savings on other routes.The strategy and focus of Government will be to continue to develop these and other strengths of the real economy to bring increased employment and prosperity to our people.However many challenges lie ahead including adjusting our public finances, containing the horrendous mistakes made by our banking sector, and the overriding priority of getting people who have lost their jobs back to work. These challenges can only be surmounted by building on the strengths of the real economy.To restore prosperity, to provide jobs and to ensure we are in a position to benefit from an upturn in the international economy, we are determined that those who take risks to create investment and jobs will be rewarded.To restore confidence and a sense of fairness we will ensure that all the relevant agencies of the State continue to vigorously pursue and punish any wrongdoing that led to our current difficulties.And to restore our standing with the people, we will be guided by the compass of what is right and best for Ireland to help to turn the corner towards a path of economic growth and renewed prosperity.So all of us here know our responsibility and the job we must do. We have to accept that the demands of leadership are hard, and that doing the right thing for our economic future may upset some people. We will put the country first - all of the country - not regional interests or vested interests.In planning responses to unemployment, it is useful to reflect on why unemployment has risen so fast given that many of the fundamental strengths of the Irish economy remain in place, exports have continued to grow and the economy returned to growth in GDP in the first quarter of 2010.While our export oriented manufacturing has continued to grow and we have continued to attract new foreign investment projects, we have faced a very severe downturn in the building and construction sector as well as declines in domestic demand and in retailing and services.The sectors which have declined are very labour intensive and to tackle the country’s unemployment problems, we are taking an integrated approach that continues to develop export oriented businesses but which also provides as much help as possible to certain labour intensive sectors.
I, of course, would welcome input from the Parliamentary Party on new initiatives or actions which could build on the work already done. Further initiatives for consideration should include:• Measures to boost employment in the labour intensive tourism sector;• Initiatives to support employment in building/construction trades focused on home improvement projects;• Ideas on how to increase public contract opportunities for indigenous small and medium sized businesses;• Examining options for the selected sale of non-core State assets in order to expand employment intensive, small-scale capital projects.• New opportunities for unemployed people to contribute to voluntary/community projects.Other significant measures that we have taken to deal with unemployment and which are having a major impact are:• the Implementation of a €40 billion Capital Investment Programme;• the €500 million Innovation Fund;• the Employment Subsidy Scheme which will help keep 80,000 workers in jobs;• the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund.The Capital Investment Programme is designed to boost productivity through improved infrastructure.The Innovation Fund is about providing greater access to venture capital for enterprises with new business ideas.The Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund are maintaining significant levels of employment in viable but vulnerable businesses.All our efforts, in restructuring the banking system, in stabilising the public finances and in reducing costs, are driven by the absolute priority of getting sustainable growth back into the economy, creating the jobs we badly need.We have a clear strategy for creating jobs and we are open and ready to take new measures where appropriate and feasible.We also have ambitious job creation initiatives in six broad areas based on industry wide reviews in key sectors.:- foreign direct investment,- small businesses,- the agri-food sector- tourism- green enterprise, and- making Ireland a Global Innovation Hub.The final part of our strategy is to ensure the labour market operates in a way which translates economic growth into new jobs.This means having the right incentives for employers to create jobs, and that people on the Live Register are supported to take-up those jobs.We are up for this challenge and we want all sectors of the economy and society to work with us on a sustained national jobs effort.It is, of course, imperative that we achieve the €3 billion correction in savings in our budget for next year that we have agreed with the EU Commission. This has to be done to continue with the work of restoring order to the public finances, so people can have confidence that Ireland is back on-track.We have made a fiscal correction of 5% of GDP in 2009 and 2.5% in 2010. Without these measures, our budget deficit would have ballooned to 20 per cent. So, we must persevere with the agreed deficit reduction programme over the coming years.The past weeks shows us that money markets remain difficult and we must be constantly vigilant in this regard. This recession has changed the financial world. The lesson we need to take from it is that we are in a competitive global market-place and soft option solutions are not going to provide the basis for sustainable growth and the improvement of living standards.Stable public finances are a prerequisite for Ireland’s speedy return to prosperity. That is why we must keep on course with our multi-annual budgetary plan to reduce the deficit progressively to three per cent over the coming years.We should not be afraid to be confident about the future. We have a credible plan to manage Ireland through this crisis and that plan is working. The resolute actions that we have taken are now producing positive results.On the budgetary side, our plans for stabilising the economy this year are on track. Our exchequer figures are on target.The end of August returns provide clear evidence that the public finances are stabilising. Economic recovery, that is export led, will assist this process and our international competitiveness is also improving. We are attracting new investment and creating jobs in foreign and Irish-owned industry.The economic outlook for 2010 has most commentators, including the Central Bank and ESRI, now forecasting positive growth for this year.This was reinforced with the CSO figures for the first quarter which showed that Ireland is out of recession with GDP expanding by 2.7% for the first quarter of the year, which is the fastest growth rate in the OECD. This underlines how much work has been done to get Ireland back on track.The IMF in its World Economic Outlook published in April 2010, expects GDP in Ireland to grow by €194 Billion between 2010 and 2015. The European Commission predicts that the Irish economy will return to positive growth in 2011 and that Ireland’s growth rate will be the second fastest in the Eurozone at 3%. It predicts a modest fall in unemployment from 13.8% in 2010 to 13.4% in 2011.The ESRI’s “Recovery Scenarios” document described two macro-economic scenarios; a high growth scenario predicated on the Irish economy responding to world economic growth and changes in competitiveness in the same way that it has done over the past twenty years, and the low growth scenario in which the Irish economy, for a number of reasons, records lower rates of growth over the medium term. The ESRI concludes that even in the low growth scenario, the economy has the potential to grow at over 3% per year over the coming decade, despite significant short-term problems.The Government is determined to ensure that Ireland’s economic recovery is built on the type of innovative export-led growth that drove our earlier economic expansion.We must drive on with our approach because it is the only credible one to get more people back to work as quickly as possible. That means working together with government colleagues until 2012 and building on the solid foundations we now have in place to restore recovery.While we face another difficult budget ahead, Ireland is returning to growth and with it we are seeing some signs of an upturn in much needed confidence.As confidence returns and jobs are created, the fortunes of our country and our party will improve.I believe we must hold our nerve and do what we know in our hearts and heads is right. We will use this period of time in government as one where we will help the country weather the storm and manage Ireland through some of the most difficult economic conditions we have had to confront since the foundation of the State.
