Good evening, elections are about choice. Never have the choices been so clear. Canada needs a strong active national government to speak for all Canadians, to keep our economy growing, to protect our public healthcare system,  to give Canadians the dignity of work, to help the most vulnerable in society, to prepare for the new economy of the future, and to cut taxes in a fair way for middle and low income Canadians. Others advocate a very different approach;  a weak national government that leaves almost everything including healthcare to market forces or to the province alone. Canadians expect much more. We are more than just citizens of a single province or a single region. We are more than just tax-payers. We are citizens of a great country. We have responsibilities to each other. We need a national government to protect and strengthen the social fabrics of our society and the unity of our country. Canada is on the right track; our economy has never been stronger. Let us continue to work together to ensure that the Canada of tomorrow leaves nobody behind.
